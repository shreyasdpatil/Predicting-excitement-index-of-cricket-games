The pacers had bowled exceptionally well on a wicket which provided them some support. Cummins looked fiery and in his first spell of 2 overs, gave away just three runs and accounted for 2 wickets. Botha consolidated a bit in the middle, but when he fell, things looked bleak for South Africa. But as they say, when the going gets tough, the tough get going and Parnell & Theron proved just that. They are into the cricketing record books now, for this is the highest 8th wicket partnership in T20 Internationals.",
