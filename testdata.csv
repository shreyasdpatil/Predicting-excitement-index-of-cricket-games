"Where did this change? You don't need to be a rocket scientist to know that. The first half of the first innings was all about Gujarat, they were rampaging through SRH bowling like a wild horse and then they ran out of steam. As if the blinkers blinded them. The chariot crashed and never recovered. They did make a momentary comeback when SRH started the chase but Warner came in their way. The Hyderabad skipper found a sensible partner in Vijay Shankar, who displayed icy cool nerves and nudged around with the senior man to see this one through.",Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 8 wkts,T20,Gujarat Lions vs Sunrisers Hyderabad,3
" Where did the game change? Two inflection points: First when Dhoni went berserk with his barrage of sixes, and then when Washington Sundar picked three wickets in two overs of his. So Pune had the momentum on either side of the innings break, and how beautifully did they ride the wave! Mumbai were caught unawares at home against their neighbours who seem to have the wood over them. Three games against Pune this season for Mumbai, and they have lost all three.",Rising Pune Supergiant won by 20 runs, T20,Mumbai Indians vs Rising Pune Supergiant,4
"The much anticipated Bengaluru rains didn't turn up tonight, KKR didn't either. Mumbai Indians continue to remain their nemesis, their bogey team. But full marks to Mumbai. The intensity with which they approached the game and set the field on fire with the ball was something to behold. Some intelligent field placements - getting Lynn like that. Some inspired selections - sticking with Karn over Harbhajan, which eventually proved to be the gamechanger. And some excellent execution. It all boiled down to the horrendous start that KKR had. They lost their footing early on with wickets tumbling everywhere, and were never able to really gain that ground back. Jaggi and Suryakumar led some sort of a recovery, but just when they threatened to take KKR to a score, Mumbai struck back again and closed the innings off for 107. That was never going to be enough, not even with Piyush Chawla bowling the way he did, and not even with Chinnaswamy's sluggish pitch.",Mumbai Indians won by 6 wkts, T20,Mumbai Indians vs Kolkata Knight Riders,4
"So a game that totally makes up for the one-dimensionality of the first game. The target of 155 set by Rajshahi Kings did feel below par on first sighting, given the arduous task of defending with dew on the other side. Kings' bowlers started well actually. Adam Lyth was picked up by Mehidy Hasan in the first over itself while the other opener, Johnson Charles, was pinned in front by Farhad Reza in the fourth. Solid contributions from Mohammad Mithun (46 from 33) and Shahriar Nafees (35 from 34) kept Rangpur in the game, setting the stage for Ravi Bopara and Thisara Perera to seal it in the end with increasing ease.",Rangpur Riders won by 6 wkts, T20,Rajshahi Kings vs Rangpur Riders,3
"Sylhet spoiled things as the match approach its end and had to sweat hard in the end to register their second win. After Tharanga and Fletcher provided a prolific starts, it appeared to be a cakewalk of sorts for them. But some superb spin show from Nabi and Rashid Khan checked the runs in the middle overs to tighten the equation. However, in the end it turned out to be another great day for Sylhet who have now gained an unstoppable momentum.",Sylhet Sixers won by 4 wkts, T20,Sylhet Sixers vs Comilla Victorians,3
"A comprehensive victory for Dhaka Dynamites. Chasing a huge score, Khulna didn't get off to an auspicious start as they lost two early wickets. Walton, though kept going after the bowlers and played one shot too many. He perished for a 13-ball 30 to Shakib. Mahmudullah and Rossouw were dismissed in quick succession and the game was almost sealed there. Khaled Ahmed, on debut, took two wickets and reduced Khulna to 88-7. That's when Archer was joined by Mosharraf Hossain at the crease and together they added 40 runs for the eighth wicket with the former top-scoring with 36. Narine picked two wickets in the end to finish the formalities. Earlier in the evening, Delport and Lewis were involved in a century partnership which helped the Dynamites post a mammoth score of 202.",Dhaka Dynamites won by 65 runs, T20,Khulna Titans vs Dhaka Dynamites,3
"A walk in the park for Rajshahi Kings. After reducing the Riders to a below-par score of 134 on a slowish track, the batsmen didn't put a foot wrong. The Kings' openers - Simmons and Mominul - went after the bowling from the third over after getting their eye in. At the end of the powerplay, they were 48-0. Mortaza and Co. weren't effective with the ball and allowed both the openers to register their respective fifties. The 122-run stand was broken by Thisara Perera who picked two wickets within a span of 4 balls, but the damage was already done. The Kings won with 20 balls to spare.",Rajshahi Kings won by 8 wkts,T20,Rangpur Riders vs Rajshahi Kings,4
"Wow! The table toppers have been massacred by the home team. Just imagine what would have been their case if Sylhet's final pair had not added those 40+ runs. Chasing a below-par score, DD sent out two of their most powerful strikers to open the innings. Afridi went BOOM BOOM straightaway and Lewis joined the party. They raced away to 59 - more than 50% of the target - in four overs. Bresnan struck twice in two balls, but that was the only teeny-tiny phase in the match where the visitors found success (or did they?). Shakib joined Lewis and together they blew apart the Sylhet bowlers. In total, eleven sixes were hit in the innings.",Dhaka Dynamites won by 8 wkts,T20,Dhaka Dynamites vs Sylhet Sixers,3
"A comprehensive win for Khulna Titans after posting an above-par score of 170. The Vikings lost their top four inside five overs. And from there, it was always going to be a tough task for them. Misbah was joined by Raza and they added 49 runs, the latter being the aggressor. Misbah couldn't find his timing and was dismissed for 30 with his strike rate around 80. Reece and Hayder played their shots in the end, but there was no way Chittagong could go past the finishing line.",Khulna Titans won by 18 runs,T20,Chittagong Vikings vs Khulna Titans,3
"The victorians fluffed in the first seven overs, losing both openers and scoring under six, but once Imrul Kayes and Buttler got together there was a spring in the step. The duo injected the much-needed momentum with some clean ball striking and had the asking rate under their grasp. Both fell out looking for biggies, but Samuels 8-ball 17 was the perfect cameo they needed to complete what has been a magnificent night for them. And thus, with this victory they leap to second in the points table.",Comilla Victorians won by 6 wkts,T20,Comilla Victorians vs Chittagong Vikings,3
"A comfortable run-chase from the Rajshahi Kings, sweeping off Sylhet's challenge of 147 without too much bother. The pitch was too good, and the target too small. Once that opening partnership between Mominul Haque and Rony Talukdar found some rhythm, it became very difficult for Sylhet to pull things back. They did fight back with three quick wickets, but Zakir Hasan's quickfire half-century killed them off.",Rajshahi Kings won by 7 wkts,T20,Rajshahi Kings vs Sylhet Sixers,3
"There were a few crests and troughs in the Khulna innings. But that was until Mahmudullah and Ariful Haque got together. The duo took their time early on and didn't panic, even with the required rate touching nine. Then, to ease the pressure, Ariful unleashed a couple of smashing blows and turned it in Khulna's favour. That almost sealed the game. Mahmudullah did the rest by taking his team home along with Brathwaite who gave a striking glimpse of his power in just the two balls that he faced.",Khulna Titans won by 5 wkts,T20,Khulna Titans vs Chittagong Vikings,3
"Dhaka solidify their position at the top of the table with a commanding performance. The two West Indians - Lewis and Pollard - set it up with blistering fifties with the bat, and then the bowlers hardly gave a sniff to Rajshahi, who were just not up for it today. Catches dropped in the field, toothless bowling, and some very lacklustre batting from them, after their win yesterday. So they continue to blow hot and cold this year.",Dhaka Dynamites won by 68 runs,T20,Dhaka Dynamites vs Rajshahi Kings,3
"Excellent bowling display from the Victorians' bowlers. 153 was a par-score and they were up against a strong batting line-up. Mahedi Hasan was superb upfront with the new ball and he should have had Gayle for a golden duck. But the umpire didn't rule it in his favour. Gayle, who got two lives, started to go after the bowlers and scored three boundaries in the same over. But, the big man was tamed by the Afghanistani sensation - Rashid Khan. The leg-break trapped him off the first ball (Hawk-Eye showed it to be pitching outside leg). The spinners struck in tandem and reduced the Riders to 32-4 in the sixth over. Mithun and Bopara played cautiously and were involved in a 67-run stand. However, both of them found it hard to time the ball. In the end, Hasan Ali was once again brilliant with his variations. Comilla climb up to the second spot with this win.",Comilla Victorians won by 14 runs,T20,Rangpur Riders vs Comilla Victorians,4
"Shoaib Malik kept his head calm and took his team past the finishing line. Chasing a below-par score, Tamim came all guns blazing. He played one shot too many and perished to Narine. Malik joined hands with Kayes and together they slowly steadied the ship. Bravo and Buttler got into the double digits and were dismissed. However, the Pakistani was unruffled. He sensibly saw off Narine and went after the less experienced bowlers. The Victorians, with this win, go to the top of the table pipping the Dynamites.",Comilla Victorians won by 4 wkts,T20,Dhaka Dynamites vs Comilla Victorians,4
"Much-needed win for Rangpur Riders. They will get out of the last position with this win. What a comeback from Mortaza's men! At 25-3, Nasir Hossain was joined by Sabbir Rahman and they went after the Riders' bowlers with a century stand. At the end of 16 overs, they were 135-3, needing 35 runs. The time-out was taken and the momentum shifted towards the Rangpur side - thanks to the 2-run over from captain Mortaza. Rubel and Thisara Perera held their nerve in the death and executed the yorkers superbly.",Rangpur Riders won by 7 runs,T20,Sylhet Sixers vs Rangpur Riders,5
"Ariful Haque has won it single-handedly for Khulna. Came pretty late in the innings, when his team was virtually out of the match. Sami was bowling some brilliant yorkers and it looked all but over for Khulna. But Haque kept his calm and managed 18 runs off the 18th over, Hossain Ali was the unlucky bowler. Once the equation was achievable, he ensured that he had the strike for the last over. Needed only two balls in the last over from Smith to seal the deal. Earlier it was a valiant effort from skipper Mahmudullah which had kept them in the game for most part of the innings before some late wickets brought Rajshahi back.",Khulna Titans won by 2 wkts,T20,Rajshahi Kings vs Khulna Titans,5
"Wow, what a finish! Dhaka have somehow managed to botch their run-chase spectacularly. No question they should have got home, and should have done so comfortably. However, first, Afridi allowed Rangpur an opening when he threw his wicket away with an ugly slog. That wicket stalled their momentum appreciably. And then in the last over, with 10 required, it appeared as if Pollard would go on to finish it off after he hit a giant six off the third ball. But now in hindsight, his decision to refuse three possible singles is what came back to bite him as Perera produced two sensational yorkers off the final two balls to help Rangpur pull off a heist.",Rangpur Riders won by 3 runs,T20,Dhaka Dynamites vs Rangpur Riders,4
"A big win for the hosts. The platform was set by the batters - thanks to Raza and Ronchi - who powered Chittagong to a massive score of 211. The Sixers came out all guns blazing with Gunathilaka starting off their innings with a six. The Sri Lankan perished early, but Andre Fletcher had other plans. The West Indian went after the bowlers and the match was nicely poised with 10 overs left. He ensured that the asking rate didn't swell above their reach. But, a slower ball from Taskin led to his downfall. That's when the Sixers lost their plot. Babar Azam struggled for timing and he fell for a 32-ball 41. Soumya Sarkar and Stiaan van Zyl chipped in with two wickets apiece, which ruled out a win for Sylhet.",Chittagong Vikings won by 40 runs,T20,Chittagong Vikings vs Sylhet Sixers,3
"After a scratchy start, the Riders found momentum through their skipper Mashrafe Mortaza who surprised everyone by promoting himself up the order and smashing a 17-ball 42. That set the foundation for the rest of the batters who managed to find occasional boundaries and ensured the asking rate was always under control. With 14 needing from the final over, Taskin Ahmed showed nerves and bowled some ordinary deliveries which helped Riders upset the home team and their vibrant crowd.",Rangpur Riders won by 3 wkts,T20,Chittagong Vikings vs Rangpur Riders,3
"And so, with this win, Dhaka Dynamites leap up to the top of the ladder. The chase lacked steam until the 8th over, but Evin Lewis unleashed himself soon scoring 26 runs - which included 4 sixes - off the next over. Denly played the second fiddle, but found a way to hit timely boundaries. That injected the much-needed momentum and although the visitors lost both the aforementioned batsmen, the task never got out of hand with the likes of Shakib and Delport chewing the target with yawning ease. Unfortunately, by virtue of this loss, Chittagong Vikings find themselves with no hope of qualifying for the play-offs.",Dhaka Dynamites won by 7 wkts,T20,Chittagong Vikings vs Dhaka Dynamites,3
"Could well be the end of the road for the Kings. A woeful performance from them. In all three departments. After conceding the highest score of the season, they had to bat out of their skins to record a believe-it-or-not win. Unfortunately, their batsmen couldn't find any rhythm and kept losing wickets at regular intervals, and thus, had to cope with a huge defeat of 68 runs in the end. The Titans, on the other hand, reclaim the top spot and displace Dhaka Dynamites who possess a better net run rate among all teams.",Khulna Titans won by 68 runs,T20,Khulna Titans vs Rajshahi Kings,2
"'Small totals are always tricky to chase.' That adage holds perfectly true for this game. The top four Victorians batsmen, chasing a meagre total, tried too hard for boundaries in the initial overs and couldn't quite get going given the two-paced nature of the pitch. They somehow laboured along with decent contributions from their senior three; Tamim, Malik and Samuels. Credit to the Riders' bowlers for making a good fist of challenging the opposition despite a shambolic show with the bat.",Comilla Victorians won by 4 wkts,T20,Comilla Victorians vs Rangpur Riders,5
"That brings an end to the league rounds. Comilla Victorians stamp their authority with yet another clinical win. They never allowed Sylhet to gain the momentum. Having scored a decent total, they always were in with their noses ahead. But the way their bowlers came charging, particularly Hasan Ali, it never allowed Sylhet to have a go at the target. Liton Das is adjudged the Man of the Match for his heroics with the bat.",Comilla Victorians won by 25 runs,T20,Comilla Victorians vs Sylhet Sixers,3
"Khulna Titans are out of the tournament. And courtesy this 8-wicket canter, Rangpur Riders get another shot at finale. Gayle gets a big hug from Mortaza, who won a good toss, kept the target in check and allowed Gayle and Co. to unleash. But credit to Gayle for making the most of it, in the form of his fourth BPL hundred which helped him climb to the second spot on the list of run-makers this season. He hit 14 sixes, the most in an innings in BPL and gunned Khulna down as early as in the powerplay. This game was over before you could realize.",Rangpur Riders won by 8 wkts,T20,Khulna Titans vs Rangpur Riders,4
"That's a big win for Dhaka, gunning Comilla down to their first sub-hundred score in the history of BPL. There's still hope for Tamim's team. They will have a second shot at the finale berth, but can they recover from today's performance? An absolute mismatch of a contest between two top sides. Dhaka chose to bat and put the runs on the board. Despite a sluggish finish, they managed 191 which, in the end, proved to be more than enough. Comilla lost three wickets in the powerplay - Buttler being one of them - and that was a point of no return. Afridi got Tamim and Bravo in the same over when Comilla were looking to mount a partnership and that killed any hopes of a fightback.",Dhaka Dynamites won by 95 runs, T20,Comilla Victorians vs Dhaka Dynamites,2
"Joy for Mortaza. The fourth BPL title for him manifesting itself as Rangpur's first ever in the tournament's short history. Apt that Gayle gets to wrap the innings with the ball, after all but wrapping defending champions Dhaka with a blistering 69-ball 146 - his highest ever score in BPL that also happens to be the first century scored in the tournament's finale. Chasing 207, Dhaka looked baked. They didn't do themselves any favours, losing four inside the powerplay. Mortaza kicked things off with Maruf's wicket in the first over and then Gazi struck in consecutive overs, plundering away any chance Dhaka had at a rearguard. Jahurul Islam's rather quickfire fifty was as consolatory as it gets.",Rangpur Riders won by 57 runs,T20,Dhaka Dynamites vs Rangpur Riders,3
"A comprehensive win for Sirsa Warriors. Chasing a target of 131, their openers got them off to a flier and gave no openings whatsoever to their opponents. Kapil Kumar scored a dashing 73 with a strike rate of 192.11. He put on a 118-run stand with Talwinder for the first wicket. Panchkula Kings picked up four wickets, but it was all too late.",Sirsa Warriors won by 6 wkts, T20,Panchkula Kings vs Sirsa Warriors,3
What a match we had today. Sirsa were up against a mountain but got off to a flier. Gurugram pulled things back but Sarun kept batting with tremendous belief. Had the confidence of a lion to take the total down. Almost managed that but departed in the second last over to make the equation a little too tough. In the end Ankush Dhariwal held his nerves and helped Gurugram pull off this one.,Gurugram Gladiators won by 4 runs, T20,Sirsa Warriors vs Gurugram Gladiators,5
"A comprehensive win for Lancashire. James Anderson and his new ball partner - Mahmood set the tone scalping Hain and Barker respectively. Bell and Ambrose put on a 50-run stand for the third wicket. Once that was broken by Stephen Parry, there was no looking back for Lancashire. Parry finished with impressive figures of 3-12 off his quota of four overs and ensured that there wasn't any opening for Birmingham back in the game.",Lancashire won by 63 runs, T20,Lancashire vs Birmingham,2
"Lahore Qalandars win but only just. Feasting merrily on the no-balls and wides, mainly towards the end of the innings, Aaron Thomason stroked 44 off 27 to take Birmingham real close. Overs seventeen to nineteen yielded 42 runs, but in quite an anticlimax, Thornton ran out big-hitting Thomason and that was it, perhaps, as much as the wide off the first ball of the last over, with only 13 needed, might have suggested otherwise.",Lahore Qalandars won by 6 runs, T20,Lahore Qalandars vs Birmingham,4
"New Zealand win by 61 runs (DLS), snapping Pakistan's nine-match winning streak. With that persistent drizzle adamant on getting only heavier, this was on. Pakistan lost many wickets in a cluster early in the chase and that after conceding the highest ever ODI score at Wellington, thanks to Williamson's 10th ODI century. Wasn't going to be easy, was it, with rain or no rain around. It can be said that except their brief period of recovery post Munro onslaught and Zaman's delicious innings later, Pakistan don't have much to take away from the game.",New Zealand won by 61 runs (DLS method ), ODI,New Zealand vs Pakistan,2
"A fine contest was setup by the Pakistan lower-order and Hafeez after a top-order collapse and NZ were set 247 to win. After getting the key wickets of Williamson and Munro, Pakistan were clearly ahead. However, rain played spoilsport in the 100th match party between the two sides as the Kiwis were set a revised target. Martin Guptill and Ross Taylor laid into the attack with a flurry of sixes after the rain delay to polish off the target with 7 balls to spare. So, New Zealand go 2-0 up in this five-match series, and Pakistan will have to make an extraordinary comeback in the next three games if they are to win this series.",New Zealand won by 8 wkts,  ODI,New Zealand vs Pakistan,2
"258 was always going to be difficult for Pakistan on this pitch. But little did anyone know that the visitors would scramble to avoid being bowled out for the lowest ODI score. Sarfraz hung in there, Amir produced a few edges and then Raees played a few shots to save them the blushes. The chase was off almost in the first 10 overs when Trent Boult ripped them apart with a stunning new ball spell, getting the ball to move at pace. From that point, it was about avoiding some unwanted records.",New Zealand won by 183 runs, ODI,New Zealand vs Pakistan,2
"Geez does this game turn around dramatically! Does it ever! Shadab Khan's spell was instrumental in crippling New Zealand from 88/0 to 99/4, giving Pakistan the upper hand in the chase. And then Colin de Grandhomme, that monster, did one better. He was something else tonight, overcoming the momentum deficit with hideous ease. The timing off his bat was absolutely sensational from the moment he arrived, and before you knew it, Pakistan were blown away on a pitch which was affording decent turn. Madness. ",New Zealand won by 5 wkts, ODI,New Zealand vs Pakistan,4
" New Zealand blank Pakistan 5-0! A whitewash. Well, credit to Pakistan's lower order for making a match out of this. At 57/5, it looked like this match was heading towards an embarrassing defeat for the visitors. That's when Shadab Khan stitched a 105-run stand with Haris Sohail. Both batsmen registered their respective fifties, but fell to Santner within a span of 13 balls. Aamer Yamin along with Faheem Ashraf and Mohammad Nawaz took the game deep with a couple of lusty blows along with a few inside edges. But the task was too tough and the Kiwis held their nerve when it mattered. Earlier in the day, despite a century and half-ton from Guptill and Taylor respectively, the fast bowlers squeezed the run flow towards the end to restrict NZ to par score. The top order batsmen (barring Sohail) need to be blamed for this loss. ",New Zealand won by 15 runs, ODI,New Zealand vs Pakistan,4
"An unusual pitch for a T20I match this, having plenty of pace and a little uneven bounce to make it difficult for the batsmen. So it was an excellent toss to win for New Zealand. The problem was, Pakistan didn't know their target. They went too hard at the top, rather than aiming for something which could have been defendable here. In doing so, they collapsed in a heap and were in danger of being bowled out for something rather infamous before Hasan Ali and Babar Azam saved them the blushes. Still, 105 was too light a total to defend. Amir and Raees came in steaming with the new ball, making a couple of dents up front. But New Zealand knew what they were chasing. They were able to take their time through the middle, absorbing the pressure, before finally cashing in with a few release shots. The hosts have coasted home eventually, with Taylor and Munro finishing in a flurry to go 1-0 up.",New Zealand won by 7 wkts, T20,New Zealand vs Pakistan,2
"How did Pakistan not win a game so far? They were simply outstanding today. Bossed all three departments and have kept the series alive. Having equalled their second highest T20I total, the Pakistani bowlers came all guns blazing. They had a plan to bowl at the body and they executed it to perfection, claiming three wickets inside the powerplay. Guptill battled his way through to 26 and was the highest contributor in the top-order, while 30s from Santner and Wheeler just delayed the inevitable. All the Pakistani bowlers were among the wickets, Ashraf being the pick with three. The visitors have finally arrived on tour and they have in style. ",Pakistan won by 48 runs, T20,New Zealand vs Pakistan,3
"Pakistan were simply outstanding once again. They outbatted, outbowled and even outfielded New Zealand in this game. Chasing 181 against Pakistan's bowling unit was never easy. Williamson and Guptill were tied down by some disciplined bowling. The latter kept the scoreboard ticking with a fifty but had no support from the other end as Kitchen struggled with his timing. A cow-corner-loving Ross Taylor provided New Zealand some hope with a few meaty blows, but the asking rate was a bit too much for him. Amir and Raees were brilliant at the death, while Shadab bossed the middle overs. Overall a complete team performance from Pakistan takes them to the number one spot in T20I rankings.",Pakistan won by 18 runs, T20,New Zealand vs Pakistan,4
"Not many preconceived this result. India take a 1-0 lead and win in a canter with 27 balls to spare as well. The chief architect was the skipper himself with another sublime ton. His 33rd in ODIs. And India's latest 4, tried out previously though, Rahane threw his hat into the ring for being a contender for the spot by stroking a calculative 79. Even Dhawan's quickfire 35 served as the launchpad for India's riposte.",India won by 6 wkts, ODI,South Africa vs India,3
" It's a staggering win for India at Centurion to go 2-0 up. Fifty minutes back, it would have felt a lot more staggering, but cricket's laws wouldn't have it that way. We're still reeling from how ridiculous that break for lunch was. But tough as it may be, let it not steal the thunder from Yuzvendra Chahal's maiden ODI five-for which crashed South Africa to their lowest ODI total at home. India's wrist-spinners had an extraordinary home season last year, and if there were any doubts as to their effectiveness overseas, those have been comprehensively dispelled in these first two ODIs. Chahal and Kuldeep combined for a total of eight wickets today on a slightly slow pitch at Centurion, which was to India's liking. That still doesn't explain South Africa's capitulation though. It was all too easy for the visitors from there as they romped home through breezy knocks from Dhawan and Kohli. ",India won by 9 wkts, ODI ,South Africa vs India,3
"Another one-sided affair between the number 1 and number 2 ranked sides. The results show the gulf between the two, might be momentary, but also speaks volumes about the impact of the wrist spinners. Virat Kohli. What do I say? The ton machine refuses to slow down. This is the same South African team, barring a few injuries, which won 17 consecutive ODIs on home soil. The tables have turned drastically. They would be hoping for another spin then, more so in their favour. ",India won by 124 runs, ODI,South Africa vs India,3
"It's a carnage for the ages, the digital ages. The Wanderers, in the pink of its glory refuses to disappoint. Thank the rain, thank the lightning, thank Duckworth-Lewis, thank Chahal and his foot, thank the sloppy fielding, but South Africa have finally found a way to reverse the trend, to reverse the slide. No, don't get fooled by Phehlukwayo's 23 off 5, the game was in their bag much before. Perhaps even during the first lightning break that sucked away all of India's batting momentum. And then when it looked like Miller was getting schooled while batting, Chahal's no ball was just the diploma he needed to pass out. And how.",South Africa won by 5 wkts (DLS method match reduced to 28 overs - target 202), ODI,South Africa vs India,2
"It's the spin web..again. From 166/4 when it looked like Amla was doing an, err, Amla to steer the Proteas home to folding out for 201 - it's been some collapse. But lest we forget Pandya, his nagging seemingly-nothing deliveries and that arm of his. On a ground where India were chasing a ragged record and a smashing in the last game, they've done it just how the pundits prophesise, making big runs, and stealing momentum with their spinners. For all the criticism South Africa are set to face in the times to come, they've pulled off a massive diplomatic coup with the apparent drop-in pitches from India. ",India won by 73 runs, ODI,South Africa vs India,2
"What a pasting for South Africa this. A 5-1 series defeat against India. And who better to seal it off than Virat Kohli. Three hundreds for the Indian captain in the series. He's the only player to score 500 runs in a bilateral series. The target was modest at best today, and he came out and demolished it. Take a good look world cricket. Kohli's not stopping anytime soon.",India won by 8 wkts,  ODI ,South Africa vs India,2
"India's bowlers have been truly humbled today, Yuzvendra Chahal in particular. He lived an absolute nightmare out there, with figures of 4-0-64-0. The punishment he took from Heinrich Klaasen played such a huge part in shaping the outcome of this run-chase. India had started off pretty well initially, with Bhuvneshwar and Thakur stifling the scoring. However, in a bid to get ahead of the DLS par amidst the growing drizzle, the manner in which Klaasen unleashed with his maiden T20I fifty stunned India. They just couldn't recover. Seeing how Chahal was having an off-day, should Kohli have tried someone else? Raina perhaps? We'll never know. But well done to the South Africa batsmen. Their two wins on this limited-overs tour have come when they've played without fear. Maybe there's a trick there.",South Africa won by 6 wkts, T20,South Africa vs India,2
" If not for Jonker's feat on debut, this match was dead a long time ago. India's 172 might have divided opinions at the halfway stage but South Africa soon found that it shouldn't have. They were chasing an above par score on a pitch responsive to cutters and change of pace, something which conspired a dragged 52/2 from the hosts after 10 overs. A punt with Miller at the opening slot backfired, Klaasen didn't quite have this night to himself, and Duminy's 55 could have only taken them so far.",India won by 7 runs, T20,South Africa vs India,5
"So, Kohli's first ton in ODIs against South Africa in South Africa has paved the way for a comfortable win for the Indians. Both the skippers got tons but Faf never had the Man Friday that Kohli had in the form of Rahane. He looked in complete control and sailed through for most of his 79 runs playing seamers and spinners with astute footwork. India have broken South Africa's string of 17 wins in ODIs at home as well. The South African think tank will have to turn it around quickly. How quickly, we will figure out soon. ",India won by 6 wkts, ODI,South Africa vs India,3
"What a special knock we've witnessed from Jason Roy tonight to help England complete their highest successful run-chase in Australia. In fact, this is only the second time that a 300-plus score has been chased in Australia. This wasn't a flat track. It had life in it in terms of pace and bounce - as highlighted by all the wickets which England lost - and to score 180 while chasing is a phenomenal effort. The way he met fire with fire against Starc and Cummins with the new ball, sending it flying everywhere, that was the defining phase. It set Australia back to such an extent that they never could recover. Roy didn't stop there. He made it count and how. He had Root for company as his shadow. You barely noticed him, despite the fine 91 which he made. It was all about Jason Roy. Take a bow!",England won by 5 wkts, ODI,Australia vs England,3
"England have pretty much schooled the hosts in these first two one-dayers. If not for Mitchell Starc's threat, they'd have packed this up so much sooner, which is incredible considering they've won with over five overs to spare. Australia opted to beef up their batting today, thereby sacrificing the spinner on a pitch where the opposition spinners thrived. They then landed in trouble when the batting under-delivered to finish with a well below par score. With a pretty one-dimensional attack up their sleeve, and just the part-time of Head as the spinning option, it was always going to be difficult. Hales and Bairstow's start set England on their way, and then Root hung around to steer the side home like he did at the MCG.",England won by 4 wkts, ODI,Australia vs England,3
"England tried about as hard as a team can try from 8/5, to make a match of it. Woakes's majestic fifty led the recovery to get some sort of a score on the board. He then got Warner reasonably early with the new ball too. Adil Rashid chipped away at the wickets through the middle. But Travis Head, filling in for an injured Finch at the top, was determined to get Australia on the board in this series. The left-hander scored freely, cutting away at the target and should have had a hundred to his name before being unfortunately denied there at the end. It was an excellent toss to win in the morning under overcast skies and on a wicket where the new ball decked around. Cummins and Hazlewood cashed in thoroughly as England capitulated to their worst ever ODI start. They had four top-order batsmen getting ducks. Credit to the visitors for taking it this far. ",Australia won by 3 wkts, ODI,Australia vs England,3
"As flawless as it gets for Bangladesh. Once their bowlers restricted Zimbabwe to 170, the result was virtually sealed. The only way the visitors could have stayed afloat in the game was to pick early wickets and although they got Anamul after his cameo, Tamim and Shakib stitched a fluent partnership to ensure that there would be no alarms. The newly promoted no.3 couldn't see it off till the end but Tamim did so and along with Rahim ensured that the win was achieved with more than 21 overs to spare. Forgettable game for Zimbabwe, only Raza stood up for them in the game, both with the bat and ball while the others didn't even compete. They would need to pick up their game drastically for the rest of the tournament. As for the home side, this is the perfect start.",Bangladesh won by 8 wkts, T20,Bangladesh vs Zimbabwe,2
"An absolutely riveting encounter here at the neutral Shere-Bangla national stadium at Mirpur! After Masakadza gave Zimbabwe a solid start, it was Sikandar Raza who made an aggressive 81* to add the finishing touches to the Zimbabwean innings as they ended up on an above-par 290. The Sri Lankan run-chase started off on a positive note, as Kusal Perera got them off to a flyer. Mathews stabilized the innings after a few quick wickets, but his dismissal brought about a collapse. Thisara Perera gave the Zimbabweans a mighty scare but gifted his wicket to a full-toss, and Zimbabwe held their nerve in the end to do the formalities and clinch a nail-biter of a contest. A thrilling encounter between two evenly matched sides, but the one that held its nerve ended up on triumphant...",Zimbabwe won by 12 runs, T20,Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe,4
"So, Sri Lanka keep their hopes alive and have joined Zimbabwe with four points. It now boils down to who can beat Bangladesh in their last game or who loses less badly. At 145/5, the Lankans had played themselves into a corner, but Thisara, who has been their lone saving grace so far came up with a fine cameo. Dinesh Chandimal looked less fluent, but fought hard and didn't throw his wicket away. The early damage was done by Kusal Perera (49) and Kusal Mendis (36), but they once again they nearly threw it away - thanks to a three-wicket burst from Blessing Muzarabani. To their credit, Zimbabwe kept fighting along, took the game to as deep as they could, they will be disappointed with their batting effort, but have quite a few plus points over the way they bowled and fielded.",Sri Lanka won by 5 wkts, T20,Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe,3
"It was never going to be easy, but Zimbabwe made it even more difficult by playing some reckless shots. Masakadza and Mire threw it away, so did Craig Ervine. Sikandar Raza and Peter Moor arrested the slide with a steady partnership, but once that was broken it was one-way traffic. All the Bangladeshi bowlers were among the wickets, Mortaza and Shakib gave them the perfect start - picking four wickets in the first powerplay. The rest then contributed to wrap Zimbabwe for a paltry 125. This is the fourth lowest total that Bangladesh have successfully defended.",Bangladesh won by 91 runs, T20,Bangladesh vs Zimbabwe,4
"Bangladesh have had a shocker today, going down to their heaviest defeat against Sri Lanka in terms of balls left. It was a game where a win would have taken Sri Lanka to the final, and their body language showed how badly they wanted this. Suranga Lakmal set the tone with the ball, with appreciable help from Danushka Gunathilaka who was on fire in the field. Thisara Perera followed it up brilliantly, and then Bangladesh did the rest as they crumbled to 82 - their eighth lowest ODI total. The two Lankan openers had no problems in hammering the target down, thereby finishing it off with around half an hour left for the lunch break. Crazy..",Sri Lanka won by 10 wkts, T20,Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka,4
"Plenty of smiles in the Sri Lankan camp as they walk off the field. What a tour it has been for them since losing the first couple of games in the triangular ODI tournament. They bounced back to win that trophy, then won the Test series, and have now swept the T20I series too. An abject batting performance from Bangladesh today, as they got off to a dismal start and were never in the hunt in the chase of 211. The hosts weren't able to defend 193 the other day. They decided to bat second today, but it only proved counter-productive as Sri Lanka racked up the runs with Kusal Mendis opening the floodgates at the top. With the comfort of a huge target, the Lankan bowlers didn't face much of a challenge as Bangladesh were quite happy to capitulate.",Sri Lanka won by 75 runs, T20,Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka,3
"Phewf! That was quick. Let's be honest here: New Zealand didn't have the runs; they pretty much lost it inside the first half of the first innings, (lost their top four inside 8 overs) and never found the road to recovery. de Grandhomme's 24-ball 38 only helped in coruscating a sorry scoreboard, and Australia with two of their best T20 batsmen - Lynn and Maxwell - made the chase look like a cheesecake.",Australia won by 7 wkts (DLS method-Match reduced to 15 ovs due to rain target 95), T20,Australia vs New Zealand,2
"The crowd are going ballistic here at the Bellerive Oval. Six, ton and a win to wrap up the match. Maxwell, the hero! He came to bat in when Willey removed Warner and Lynn in the very first over of the chase. The Victorian all-rounder along with D'Arcy Short, not only steadied the ship, but also kept the asking rate under check with a 70+ partnership for the third wicket. Maxwell lost three partners, but he had a calm head over his shoulders. He put a price on his wicket and ensured that he took the team over the finishing line. A superb all-round performance from the hosts. Earlier in the evening, their bowlers did a fantastic job to restrict the England score to 155, from 96/3 in the tenth over.",Australia won by 5 wkts, T20,Australia vs England,4
"A magnificent performance from the home team. Chasing a par-score, Australia lost their skipper Warner in the very first over. But, that didn't stop Lynn from going after the bowlers. He came out all guns blazing and his quickfire 31 off 19 brought the asking rate down to 6. After his dismissal, D'Arcy Short was joined by the in-form Maxwell and together they just took the game away from the Englishmen. They took special liking to the spinners, scoring 39 off two overs and the game was dusted there. Finch, with his lusty blows, ensured an early finish. A thumping win with 33 balls to spare.",Australia won by 7 wkts, T20,Australia vs England,3
"Three losses in three matches for England in this tri-series. Chasing a stiff target, England lost Jason Roy early in the innings. However, Alex Hales took the attack to the England bowlers and was involved in a fifty partnership with Malan. The former was scalped by the impressive leggie - Ish Sodhi - and England lost their momentum there. Dawid Malan kept losing partners, but that hamper him as he went onto post yet another fifty - his third in as many T20Is. Just when he and Willey were threatening to take the game deep, Santner cut the partnership. Trent Boult executed the yorkers with impeccable accuracy to wrap up the match.",New Zealand won by 12 runs, T20,New Zealand vs England,4
"What a win for the Aussies! England must be thrilled with this result. This is the highest total to be chased down in T20Is. Chasing a huge score, Warner and D'Arcy Short came out all guns blazing and got Australia off to a flying start. Both the left-handed batsmen scored their respective fifties and raced to 114 in eight overs. Ish Sodhi removed the Australian captain and bowled a decent spell (4-0-35-1), but the runs kept leaking at the other end. Wheeler was taken to the cleaners and the nightmare came to a premature end as he was taken off the attack for bowling two above-waist no-balls. Finch performed the final rites by scoring 36 off just 14 balls.",Australia won by 5 wkts, T20,New Zealand vs Australia,3
"A pot-boiler of a game. The stakes were high and both teams take something out of it. NZ indeed take the larger chunk as they are through to the finale. But England with their death bowling showed it is not all about their batting line up that should be making headlines. The Kiwis started off on a usual note with Munro smashing a fifty off only 18 balls, third time he has done it in his international career in 18 balls or lesser. That meant NZ always looked like qualifying and that was further bolstered with Guptill's fifty. But some amazing yorkers towards the end from Jordan and Curran ensured England pipped New Zealand to the post for a consolation win.",England won by 2 runs, T20,New Zealand vs England,5
"Starting at No.7, Australia are now the second-ranked T20I team in the world, and by just decimal points behind Pakistan, having won their sixth game on the trot to equal their longest winning streak in Twenty20 Internationals. The win was set up by the bowlers, who saw through all the talks of bats and sixes and high scores to unmask the real Eden Park pitch, which was responsive to change of pace tonight. Agar starred with his three wickets, building well on Stanlake and Richardson's efforts to send back Guptill and Munro inside a fiery powerplay. And then Short took off until rain put the brakes on, twice. But it can only do so much.",Australia won by 19 runs (DLS method due to rain),T20,New Zealand vs Australia,2
"Convincing from Afghanistan, despite the fact that they've lost five wickets in a small chase. It was all set up by the bowlers in the first innings, who dragged Zimbabwe from scoring 50 inside 5 overs to just 120/9 in 20 overs. Slower balls from pacers did the trick and then Rashid Khan picked three on a sluggish pitch. Shahzad scored a quickfire 20 on his return from the one-year doping ban and despite wickets falling regularly, Nabi's 27-ball 40 made short work of the chase.",Afghanistan won by 5 wkts, T20 ,Afghanistan vs Zimbabwe,2
"A superb performance from Afghanistan. The batsmen posted a par-score of 158 and that was enough for their spinners. Masakadza did hit a couple of boundaries, but couldn't convert it into something substantial. At the halfway stage, the Zimbabweans were 62/3. That's when Ryan Burl and Raza joined hands. They were involved in a fifty partnership, but Stanikzai had Rashid Khan's overs up his sleeves and the leg-spinner didn't disappoint the captain. Bowling four overs on the trot from the 13th over, the 19-year-old was at his economical best. He picked the wickets of Raza and Burl to finish with figures of 4-0-23-2.",Afghanistan won by 17 runs, T20,Afghanistan vs Zimbabwe,3
"Zimbabwe have been annihilated here at Sharjah. Enough damage was done in the first half of the innings where Afghanistan scored a massive 333 on the back of Rahmat Shah's century. The Zimbabwe openers were involved in a 50-run stand, but Mire's dismissal opened the floodgates. The Afghan spinners once again came to the party. Even before Rashid Khan was introduced the African side had lost four wickets. The 19-year-old leg-spinner picked three wickets in three overs to derail Zimbabwe's chase completely. He wrapped up the match by removing Vitori.",Afghanistan won by 154 runs, ODI,Afghanistan vs Zimbabwe,3
"Deja vu game, just that the teams exchanged roles. Zimbabwe posted the same score Afghanistan did in the first ODI, 333, and then the opponents folded for the exact same score, 179. Another coincidence is the 47th over in the first innings of both matches, both of which had 3 no balls apiece. Spooky?? Anyways, back to this one, Afghanistan never really turned up. Their bowlers were smashed around by Taylor and Raza earlier in the evening and then the batsmen just capitulated. Could have been embarrassing if not for the thrilling last-wicket stand between Dawlat and Mujeeb. Clinical stuff from Zimbabwe and the series is squared now.",Zimbabwe won by 154 runs, ODI,Afghanistan vs Zimbabwe,3
"Crushing win for Afghanistan, set up by their star spinner Rashid Khan, who derailed Zimbabwe with a five-for. Thereafter, they just had to ensure that the batsmen kept their minds. Fifties from Rahmat Shah and Nasir Jamal ensured that they did as they led Afghanistan's cruise to the target. Very abject performance from Zimbabwe as they descend back into misery after the highs of the previous win.",Afghanistan won by 6 wkts, ODI,Afghanistan vs Zimbabwe,2
"Comprehensive victory for Afghanistan, almost a flawless performance from the Asian team. The spinning duo of Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Zadran were the wreckers-in-chief again, this time the latter grabbed a five-wicket haul and restricted Zimbabwe to a dismal 134. Mohammad Shahzad came out firing right from the word go and in his trademark style dispatched Zimbabwean bowlers all around the park. Ihsanullah was slow to start off but once he got his eye in, he also joined the party and made a mockery of the target.",Afghanistan won by 10 wkts, ODI,Afghanistan vs Zimbabwe,2
"Zimbabwe have been once again blown away by spin. The four Afghanistan spinners shared 8 wickets between them. The African nation tried a new opening pair (Masakadza and Musakanda) - did not work. Taylor and Ervine steadied the sinking ship, but Sharafuddin Ashraf removed the former and the in-form Raza in consecutive overs. Zimbabwe's nightmare - Rashid Khan was yet to bowl an over till then. The leg-spinner was left with a few wickets and he added them to his growing kitty, finishing the series with 16 wickets.",Afghanistan won by 146 runs, ODI,Afghanistan vs Zimbabwe,2
"If this is a precedent for what is to come over the next couple of weeks, nail-cutters would be extinct. It was a foregone conclusion when Taylor and Latham were batting. And then when Rashid prized Taylor out. And then when Santner couldn't find a gap to save his life. Just what a 50-over contest gives you .. ebbs, flows and twists all through. In the end, it was Morgan's brave captaincy to bowl spin in the 48th over that went against England. But in the longer scheme of things, you'd argue the way the Kiwi bowlers pulled things back in the death with the ball was the decider. ",New Zealand won by 3 wkts, ODI,New Zealand vs England,4
"England's chase didn't exactly pan out the way they'd anticipated, but skipper Morgan repaid the selectors faith with a fiery fifty; his first in 13 games. Stokes might not have a sponsor for his willow, but it didn't take long for the Durham lad to stamp his authority in the side. Root and Roy couldn't kick on, while YJB wasted a start. And the rest is a rumble...",England won by 6 wkts, ODI,New Zealand vs England,2
"Blimey! One heck of a game that. Thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it. Not quite the run-feast, but it had all the ingredients of a heart-stopper and kept us glued throughout the game. Well, a quick gander at the scorecard might make you think that Williamson dragged this too far, but don't get fooled by the numbers. If not for him, New Zealand wouldn't have gotten as close as they did. At 80/1, they looked on course to achieve the target, but Munro's dismissal triggered a dramatic collapse, losing the next five wickets for 23 runs and slumping to 103/6. At that stage, Santner joined his skipper and the duo resurrected the chase only to fall tantalizingly short.",England won by 4 runs, ODI,New Zealand vs England,5
"New Zealand, oh New Zealand! How do you do this? England started off their innings like champions and posted a massive 335, which could have been more if not for some careless shots by the Englishmen towards the end. The New Zealand innings got off to as inauspicious a start as it could have, as the openers lost their wickets for blobs. After Williamson was wrongly adjudged caught behind, it just didn't look like it was New Zealand's day. And then it began: Ross Taylor and Latham began a partnership for the ages.",New Zealand won by 5 wkts, ODI,New Zealand vs England,3
"A convincing victory for England, one that wasn't in doubt since the start of the match. The seamers set it up beautifully, the spinners made most of the early damage and the hosts were reduced to 223 all-out - in conditions that were good for batting. It wasn't going to be enough for the bowlers to defend, but Jonny Bairstow made a mockery of the chase - belting England's third fastest ODI hundred. Hales, in for Roy, helped himself to a fifty and there were some runs for Root and Stokes as well. Delight for England, despair for the hosts as New Zealand's white-ball summer comes to an end. ",England won by 7 wkts, ODI,New Zealand vs England,3
"What a heroic effort from Sikandar Raza today, backed up by the bowlers later on. But really, it was Raza's knock which kept Zimbabwe in the game. They were in great despair at 112/6, and later at 139/7, when Raza took control of the situation and started shepherding the tail with him. Ireland probably weren't expecting to be chasing 212. They then lost wickets early, as Chisoro ripped through their top-order. Paul Stirling's run out was pretty much the final nail.",Zimbabwe won by 107 runs,ODI,Ireland vs Zimbabwe,3
"Ireland's World Cup hopes are still alive, as they claim this must-win encounter by 25 runs. Bit of a scare there at the end with the last-wicket partnership, but they probably had it under control. Boyd Rankin finishes off with a four-fer, completing an incredible turnaround for himself and his team after Kyle Coetzer tore into him in his opening spell. Scotland were off to a strong start at 94/1, before Rankin had the last laugh and castled Coetzer and proceeded to derail Scotland's chase with three wickets in three overs. There were brief spurts of a fightback from the lower-order, but the damage which that middle-order collapse had inflicted proved irreversible.",Ireland won by 25 runs,T20 ,Ireland vs Scotland,2
"A calm chase from the men from Caribbean (if you discount those 15-20 minutes of madness). Evin Lewis set the platform for the chase, Shai Hope played the anchor, Marlon Samuels was at his aggressive best and Rovman Powell applied the finishing touches. Zimbabwe were disciplined with the ball, but they rag tag on the field, making those small mistakes which eventaully came back to cost them. First loss for the hosts, but they still stay in the hunt for a place amongst the top two. As for West Indies, they are back on top of the table, having garnered six points.",Windies won by 4 wkts,T20 ,Windies vs Zimbabwe,3
"At one point when Sean Williams was going along nicely, it seemed as if Zimbabwe would get over the line quite comfortably. But his wicket was the turning point of the match. Williams had brought the equation down to 24 off 3 overs but Ervine succumbed under the pressure. He did manage to get a couple of boundaries, but none of them looked convincing enough. Eventually, the hosts fell short of the target by 3 runs. Death overs usually define the outcome of a game and it was UAE who held their nerves in both innings. Mohammad Naveed hit those late lusty blows and bagged three important scalps at the same time - he was the game changer by some distance. That dropped catch of Naveed by Raza was another match defining moment. It'll take some time for Raza to get over it. Might come back to haunt him for a few days...",UAE won by 3 runs ,T20,United Arab Emirates vs Zimbabwe,4
"What a game! It kept tilting and turning until that mighty six from Najibullah in the 48th over. However, it was the calmness of skipper Asghar Stanikzai that was the difference between Ireland and Afghanistan. Mohammad Shahzad, out of sorts for the most of the tournament, decided to turn up today. The wicket-keeper got the Asian side off to a flier with a 50-ball 54. But his wicket brought Ireland back in the game and some disciplined bowling saw them take the required rate past six. Then comes a half fit Stanikzai, who mixed caution with aggression to take his side into the 2019 World Cup.",Afghanistan won by 5 wkts,T20 ,Ireland vs Afghanistan,4
"Thakur started it and Thakur finished it. Well, that line could be quite misleading, but that's Sri Lanka's chase in a nutshell. After conceding 27 runs in the third over of the innings, India needed quick wickets to stop Sri Lanka, but that didn't happen. Half of the target was devoured in 7 overs and that gave them the breathing space to nudge and nurdle around during the middle overs. India tried their best to take it deep, but the damage was done in the powerplay overs, thanks to Kusal Perera who ripped the bowling apart and eventually put paid to India's hopes. Much to Sri Lanka's delight, this is the highest T20I chase at RPS",Sri Lanka won by 5 wkts,T20 ,Sri Lanka vs India,3
"A dumpster fire is more alive than this match ever was. The fact that Bangladesh couldn't lay into a second-string Indian side that was conceding extras and dropping catches -- as many as four -- is harrowing. And then to see young batsmen and Rohit Sharma fail in a chase sustained solely by the genius of Shikhar Dhawan must hurt, especially the new-age Bangladesh. India sailed through on yet another fifty by their left-handed opener, who's left his limitations behind in the yellow pages. What will this team do without him?",India won by 6 wkts, T20,Bangladesh vs India,2
"So there it is. India win their second consecutive game, after a disappointing opening game. SL's batting started a marathon with a sprint and tired out by the finish line and ended up at 152 after 19 overs. Shardul, who took a bit of stick the other night against SL redeemed himself with a miserly and penetrative spell today. The Indian batting started off shakily as the openers fell cheaply, only to be followed by Raina. A rare hit-wicket of Rahul followed, and there was some panic in the Indian camp, but Karthik and Pandey nudged and nurdled to accumulate the required runs and played very maturely to hand India a dominating win to lift them to the top of the table.",India won by 6 wkts, T20,Sri Lanka vs India,2
"Trust me - this has been as good a match as I have ever covered in my near 10-year career in this business. And certainly one of the most unforgettable and unbelievable finishes that I have had the privilege of calling. The game looked gone when Rubel had the ball at the start of the 19th over. Enter a man called Dinesh Karthik. Single-handedly took India to the trophy with a nerveless display that would rival, match and even outdo his great competitor MSD's many such chases - who kept him out of the Indian team for so long.",India won by 4 wkts, T20,India vs Bangladesh,3
 A tame surrender from the Windies. The innings never got going. Chadwick Walton sparked off by striking a six off the first ball but then got carried away and Nawaz with his bagful of tricks removed him off the fourth ball. Things got much worse for Windies as a quintessential collapse followed and Pakistan bowlers rolled over their top-order leaving them reeling at 15/4. The visitors just couldn't recover from the scars and it was a mere formality for Pakistan from there in wiping off the innings. Just three batsmen into double figures sums up the sorry tale of Windies' batting.,Pakistan won by 143 runs, T20,Pakistan vs Windies,1
"The match was done and dusted in the first six overs. Not wanting to repeat their abysmal batting performance from last night, the Windies took a cautious approach towards the target. Walton was the only one who looked to chase the target and even he didn't threaten. Samuels and Mohammed made it more difficult for their team with defensive batting. Ramdin and Paul struck a few blows but the match was already lost. Pakistan bowlers were clinical with the ball and why wouldn't they be as there was a mountain to defend.",Pakistan won by 82 runs, T20,Pakistan vs Windies,2
"So there we go! Windies started off really low. Lower than rock bottom. And they improved during the course of the series, and competed quite well today. Nevertheless, despite a decent batting performance (Thanks to Fletcher's 52 and Ramdin's whirlwind 42*), the bowling floundered and the Pakistan batsmen, as they have done throughout the series, spanked them all around the park, starting with Fakhar Zaman (40 off 17), and finishing off with these two young gentlemen with relieved faces running back to the dressing room.",Pakistan won by 8 wkts, T20,Pakistan vs Windies,3
" Another game turned on its head by Afghanistan's spin wizard. Bangladesh were in control at 80/3 at the halfway mark, before Rashid Khan was introduced. With his first ball, he made Mushfiqur Rahim pay for his ludicrous reverse-sweep. With his second, he bamboozled Sabbir Rahman with a googly, and that was it for Bangladesh who couldn't find it within them to recover. Of course, it was Afghanistan's late dash with the bat, plundering 52 runs in the last three overs, which allowed Stanikzai to hold Rashid back for the final ten overs and didn't allow Bangladesh the liberty to just play him off.",Afghanistan won by 45 runs, T20,Afghanistan vs Bangladesh,3
"What a frenetic finish! These low-scoring chases can often backfire for the chasing side if they take things too lightly and it nearly happened for Afghanistan. Their top three took their time, especially Ghani on a sluggish pitch as the Bangladesh bowlers stuck to their task despite not having enough runs on the board. The required run rate started to climb and one got the feeling that Afghanistan were digging themselves into a hole. However, Shenwari, promoted to number 3 started the attack towards the slog overs and then it was Nabi, who held his nerve to clinically complete the chase with seven balls to spare. Bangladesh would rue their batting performance, they were about 15-20 short and that made all the difference eventually.",Afghanistan won by 6 wkts, T20,Afghanistan vs Bangladesh,3
"A pitch that was true first up, but started to slow down during the course of the first innings, allowed Afghanistan to compile 145 with a great deal of character. Bangladesh started off poorly, as they once again struggled against Mujeeb and Nabi, and stooped to their lowest when they managed two identical run-outs in an over. It all looked bleak for the Tigers, until Mushy, their great warrior, bludgeoned five consecutive boundaries in the penultimate over and managed 21 off the over, to bring the equation down to 9 off 6. But Stanikzai had an ace up his sleeve: the world's number one T20I bowler. But the UFF (Unidentified Flying Fielder. Edit: It was Shafiqullah Shafiq) stole the show, and we are still trying to figure out who it was. Saved the game by literally an inch, as even the great Rashid almost conceded a six off the last ball. Spare a thought for Ariful Haque, who nearly pulled off a last-ball six, and missed his knighthood by a kitten's whisker. And of course, for Mushy... Need I say more?",Afghanistan won by 1 run, T20,Afghanistan vs Bangladesh,5
"Not enough runs in the bank to cause any late jitters. After losing three wickets inside 8 overs, England's Test and ODI captain got together to engineer a game-sealing 115-run stand which eventually put paid to hopes of an Aussie comeback. Morgan, who had been copping a lot of flak of late, should be credited for the way he paced the chase and his innings. Never wasted a single opportunity to stamp his authority and to his delight, he found great ally in Joe Root who steadied the ship before causing a bit of a stumble towards the end. Willey, Moeen Ali and Plunkett did their bit to put the finishing touches. Stanlake, by far, has been the best Aussie bowler on show. The rest....um, not quite!!",England won by 3 wkts, ODI,England vs Australia,3
"A great game and nearly a great chase! Right from Bairstow's cameo, this was England's game. Easy to say that after the game, but the total of 342 was quite intimidating on (quite literally) a sticky wicket in Cardiff - all thanks to Roy's 120 and Buttler's fireworks towards the end. 4 down at 110, the Aussies were, and no one would've given them a chance. But Agar and Marsh stitched together a 95-run stand with a never-say-die attitude typical of the Aussies, and almost pulled off an all-time highest run-chase for the Aussies. Moeen, too, did drop a catch but managed to compensate for it with a tight bowling spell. Darn right folks, they're down but not out. England, though, staged a late comeback and after Plunkett's key wicket of Marsh, it was England's game through and through as the tail failed to pick the variations of Rashid and the rest.",England won by 38 runs, ODI,England vs Australia,3
"A jubilant England bunch shake hands with beaming smiles on their faces. Hi-fives follow and they take a 3-0 lead in the five-match series. In all fairness, nothing out of the ordinary and unexpected transpired in the denouement. A record-breaking score of 481 carnage set England up and their bowlers didn't have to do anything out of the box, really. It was imperative for the visitors' batsmen to go after the bowling from ball one and they did show some intent. Head, Marsh and Stoinis got starts instinctively but an intimidating target must've sent chills down the spine for their batters. The required rate kept creeping up with each passing over and they were forced to play catch-up cricket as England's spin duo - Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali shared 7 spoils between them to shoot the Aussies for 239. David Willey chipped in with 2 wickets as well. ",England won by 242 runs, ODI,England vs Australia,3
"Great scenes out at Old Trafford as Jos Buttler basks in the glory of a stunning knock. England had no business winning this game from 114/8. But Buttler yanked them back from the dead, with the knock of his career. The belief with which he played that innings was just unbelievable, epitomized by his refusal to take that single which would've tied the scores. Adil Rashid played his part in that 81-run stand, but this win was all about Buttler. There've been some blistering efforts from him which have made our jaws drop, but this was something else, something special. As for Australia, if they weren't able to win this one, then well.. That must be demoralising. They had Billy Stanlake ripping through England's top-order, Kane Richardson following up in the middle, but it wasn't enough? What, really, is enough against this England team?",England won by 1 wkt, ODI,England vs Australia,4
"A comprehensive win for the hosts after scoring a mammoth 221. Short and Maxwell were nipped out in the powerplay. Then it was Australia's regular nemesis - the spin twins. Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid reduced the Australians to 72/5 in the ninth over. Just as the match was heading towards a boring one-sided encounter, skipper Aaron Finch upped the ante and kept his team in the hunt. But that enthralling knock was put off by the leg-spinner Rashid - who finished with figures reading 4-0-27-3! The pacers provided the finishing touches to wrap up the match.",England won by 28 runs,T20,England vs Australia,3
"Has been a perfect ODI game of cricket, this. Earlier in the day, it was the fireworks by MacLeod, Coetzer and rest of Scottish batsmen that set up the game for them. As a result of their aggressive batting, the hosts managed to post a massive score of 371 in the first innings. In reply, England got off to an equally decent start until the Scotland bowlers pulled it back towards the end. The visitors had the game in their kitty until Bairstow was playing but after his wicket, they somewhat lost their way. Moeen Ali and other lower order batsmen continued playing their shots but the Scots kept chipping at the wickets regularly. Eventually they beat the number one ranked ODI team and registered their first ever ODI win against England. Historic day in Scotland cricket.",Scotland won by 6 runs,ODI,Scotland vs England,4
"The match probably slipped away from Scotland when Shoaib Malik smashed an unbeaten 49 off 22 balls towards the end of the first innings. The hosts had been very disciplined until then. It was a completely different story in the chase though, which was a no-contest as Pakistan dominated from start to finish. Very premature finish at that, with Scotland getting bowled out in the 15th over. Usman Khan rocked the boat early with two wickets in his opening spell, before everyone else washed their hands in the gravy train.",Pakistan won by 84 runs, T20,Scotland vs Pakistan,2
"The chase was never really on once India ran away to a total of 208. Ireland opener James Shannon rode his luck for his maiden T20I fifty, off 29 balls, but the hosts never kept up with the required rate which climbed to a daunting 14rpo as early as the halfway mark. And once the Indian wristspinners took control, the hosts had no answers. With the batsmen needing to go after them, Kuldeep and Chahal slipped in their variations to wreck havoc through the middle. It was India's opening partnership with the bat of course which knocked the stuffing out of Ireland. Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan's massive 160-run stand put any semblance of a contest out of the window. It will take some doing for Ireland to bounce back from this pasting. ",India won by 76 runs, T20,Ireland vs India,2
"A drubbing? A thrashing? A pasting? None of these words can encapsulate India's dominance over the Irish in this brief series in Dublin. The elephant in the room: the Irish need to work on playing spin. They were troubled by spinners in the series against Afghanistan way back in December 2017, and they continue to be discombobulated by Kuldeep and Chahal, who shared 13 wickets over the last two matches. The 17th ranked side in the world were shown their place by the Indians in Dublin. Despite their Test status, Ireland are mighty short on T20 reserves. No wrist-spinners, no express-pace bowlers, and clearly no death bowlers - given that they were forced to down Kevin O'Brien in the last over today. They'll need to make some tough decisions if they are to compete in the format. As for the Indians, their bench-strength has been as effective as their first-choice XI, and they can take a lot of confidence out of this competition.",India won by 143 runs, T20,Ireland vs India,3
Windies on their part were never in the chase. Gayle's out-of-character knock where he tried to run cheeky singles signalled the Windies team that it was never going to be easy. The middle overs were choked away by the spinners and timely blows by their skipper Mashrafe meant Windies were blown of the chase even before they hit the 40 over mark. The last pair of Bishoo and Joseph threw their bats around and got personal highest scores to keep the players on the field for the entire set of 50 overs. But the game was long lost. ,Bangladesh won by 48 runs, ODI,Windies vs Bangladesh,3
"Earlier in the day, though, it was the partnership between Hetmyer and Powell that really set things up for the Windies, who had nothing to defend if it hadn't been for them. In particular, the 21-year-old Hetmyer scoring a mature, counterattacking hundred under pressure was a pleasure to watch. They put up a competitive 271 on the board, and got wickets at regular intervals before the partnership between Mushy and Mahmudullah flourished and threatened to take the game away. It was Bangladesh's game until the very last over, when Holder conjured up an incredible final over to seal the deal. ",Windies won by 3 runs, ODI,Windies vs Bangladesh,4
"Handshakes and hugs all around, Bangladesh would be a happy unit. This one went right down to the wire courtesy Rovman Powell. He is a gem of a hitter but unfortunately ended up on the wrong side of the result today. Chris Gayle looked in his elements today, he was threatening to take the match away from the Bangladesh but Rubel got him at the right time. After that what transpired in the middle overs was beyond me, there wasn't any intent from Hope. He kept consuming deliveries and never got going, there wasn't any fourth or fifth gear in his innings. Windies had to suffer, the required rate kept going up and by the time Rovman Powell arrived, it was too late. He tried his best with some lusty blows but it was never going to be enough. Earlier in the day, excellent efforts of Tamim and Mahmudullah took Bangladesh to a formidable total. Skipper Mortaza pushed himself up the order and that changed the momentum of the innings which was meandering along at one point and assisted Bangladesh in posting an above par total. Bowlers held their nerves while defending the total and Windies fell 18 runs short. ",Bangladesh won by 18 runs, ODI,Windies vs Bangladesh,4
"Smiles and handshakes all round. Windies have taken a 1-0 lead in this 3-match series. Disappointing faces in the Bangladesh camp, rightly so. A total of 143 in the first innings, then the heavens opened up to dampen their spirits and trim the target to 91 in 11 overs. Things did brighten up for the visitors as they picked up two early wickets. But Samuels and Russell launched a counter-attack and took the game away from Bangladesh. The latter being the aggressor with a blistering 35 off 21 balls and then Powell applied the finishing touches in the end. ","Windies won by 7 wkts( DLS method - Match reduced to 11 overs due to rain, target 91)", T20,Windies vs Bangladesh,3
"They all converge and hug Nazmul Islam. This has been a stellar performance from Bangladesh. Windies got off to a flier but the visitors dragged them back with wickets in the second, fourth, fifth and eighth over. Windies looked out of the game at that time but Fletcher and Powell had different ideas. They put on 58 runs for the fifth wicket and got them back into the match. But once Fletcher departed, wickets fell at regular intervals and they were left to chase 15 in the final over. Nazmul Islam portrayed nerves of steel and defended it with the ease in the end to level the series. ",Bangladesh won by 12 runs, T20 ,Windies vs Bangladesh,4
Resounding victory for Pakistan. There is a gap of 11 places between these two sides in the ICC T20 rankings and Pakistan justified that gap. Hosts were never in the game while chasing this. It was just a matter of victory margin and that was a comprehensive 74-run one in the end. Musakanda would be happy with his effort on debut but his team's effort was a disaster. Musakanda's effort with the bat and couple of lusty blows from Chigumbura and Mire were the only bright spots for Zimbabwe in the batting department.,Pakistan won by 74 runs, T20,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,3
"Smiles in the Aussie camp, it has been a long time coming for them after a tough tour to the UK where they endured a whitewash. Handshakes follow as well, joined by the Pakistan team. Defending a target of 117, they needed wickets upfront to put Aussies under pressure, but that didn't happen. Finch was in overdrive mode from the start, blazed away in no time by compiling a quickfire fifty and wrapped it up in a clinical fashion for Australia. Not to forget contributions from Short and Head. However, the man who set it all up was the big boy, Stanlake. His unchanged new ball spell fetched him a 4-fer and Pakistan never really recovered. ",Australia won by 9 wkts, T20,Pakistan vs Australia,3
"Clinical from Australia! If they were ruthless with the ball yesterday, it was the bat that did the damage today. Skipper Finch's record-breaking century all but settled the deal at the half-way mark itself. Zimbabwe needed a miracle to even make a match of it and though their top order played a few adventurous strokes, the challenge was always going to be beyond them. Australia's bowlers shared the spoils evenly with Tye and Agar being the pick of the bowlers. So, that's two successive pounding wins for Australia on successive days that virtually books them a spot in the final. Their NRR is sky-high and it will take something practically improbable to knock them out from hereon. Some questions for Zimbabwe to answer, the bowling of course suffered but their batting lacks depth as well. ",Australia won by 100 runs, T20,Australia vs Zimbabwe,3
"Wow, what a game! Nail-biter until the very end. Not the best birthday present for MS Dhoni, but that ensures a decider @Bristol in a Sunday blockbuster! A poor start to India's batting, who were struggling against the early seam movement and extra bounce. They were revived by Raina and Kohli with a partnership and the finishing touches applied by MS Dhoni as usual with a 22-run final over. Either way, 148 was a below-par total and they needed to bowl out of their skins to defend this - which they did until an aberration of a poor over by Kuldeep, conceding 16 and bringing the required rate down below 8.00. An excellent penultimate over by Umesh set Bhuvi 12 to defend off the last over, but Hales stole the show with a six off the first ball and a four off the second to seal the win. India clearly missing the services of Bumrah today, but a fantastic contest to watch today.",England won by 5 wkts, T20 ,England vs India,4
"Another convincing win in the end for South Africa. 245 wasn't a threatening total but the Lankans definitely had a respectable score, considering the sluggish pitch. However, the first 15 overs of the chase saw some shambolic fielding and catching from the hosts with both de Kock and Amla dropped once each. You cannot afford to make such blunders and the duo put the South Africans in control with a fine opening stand. Amla couldn't convert the start but his partner smacked the bowling around and was unlucky to get out in the 80s. du Plessis too looked fluent though even he couldn't bat through. There was a slight hiccup at one point but Duminy and Mulder kept things in check to ensure that the visitors didn't implode. While the fielding was disastrous, Sri Lanka's bowling too looked toothless barring Dananjaya who shone again. He didn't get the required support.",South Africa won by 4 wkts, ODI ,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,3
"Sri Lanka's ODI miseries multiply with each passing series. Dhananjaya de Silva achieved his highest score in ODI cricket and that has been the only shining light in an otherwise sorry-looking scorecard. They lost 4 wickets inside 12 overs and the move to promote Thisara Perera didn't produce the desired outcome either. The partnership between Dhananjaya de Silva and Akila Dananjaya - 95 - only proved to be effective in reducing the defeat margin. The track was a belter and Sri Lanka will, most definitely, feel that they've missed out on a great opportunity here. Ngidi and Phehlukwayo shared seven wickets between them. In contrast, the hosts' frontline pacers could only manage 2. You know where the game's lost, ain't it?",South Africa won by 78 runs, ODI,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,2
"The target was 191 in 21 overs and the Proteas were cruising at one stage with Duminy going great guns, but he attempted a suicidal run three balls after Klaasen was dismissed and opened the door for Sri Lanka. Thisara bowled exceptionally well at the death, sticking to bowling only back of a length and not trying the fancy yorkers or slower balls. Two overs, 13 runs and a wicket was what he managed and then Lakmal learnt from what Thisara was doing succesfully - bowl the hard length with the pitch helping the ball to skid. His slower ball to Miller with 8 needed off 5 in the final over was great execution and from there on, Sri Lanka had it in their hands.",Sri Lanka won by 3 runs, ODI,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,5
"Hugs and handshakes all around. Skipper Mathews will be a happy man. It was almost a perfect match for his team. They put a formidable score on the board and South Africa never looked like chasing it down. Suranga Lakmal started it off with a snorter to get rid of Amla and South Africa did not recover from that. Akila was the wrecker-in-chief for the hosts. He bamboozled South Africans with his sorcery and they had no clue about the variations that he had up his sleeves. He ended up with exceptional figures of 6-29. Skipper Quinton was the only bright spot in Proteas' batting, he put up a valiant fight and scored a fifty to provide some respectability to the final total. Only four batsmen could manage to get into double digits and that sums up the batting effort of South Africa.",Sri Lanka won by 178 runs, ODI ,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,3
"It was a narrow escape in the end for Sri Lanka. Their supporters must have had their hearts in the mouth in the second half of the run-chase. But Chandimal, in his comeback match brought his experience to the fore and guided his team to a memorable victory. The target was an ordinary one and Sri Lanka definitely made a mountain out of a molehill. Rabada was fiery in his 4-over spell and got two wickets in his first over but South Africa still needed more. Dhananjaya de Silva joined Chandimal and both portrayed good counter-attacking cricket. They were coasting at one point of time but Shamsi with Dala came into the attack and the duo were exceptional. With combined figures of 4-48, made it really interesting but South Africa seriously missed another quality spinner and once their spell was over, Chandimal and Udana took the hosts home.",Sri Lanka won by 3 wkts,T20,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,4
"A walk in the park for Pakistan then. A win by 201 runs and Zimbabwe need to find answers. They just cannot afford to play this badly, need to show some fight. 309 was always going to be difficult against a high quality bowling line-up. More than the loss, the lack of application is what the Zimbabwe think tank need to worry about. Only three batsmen crossed 20. The seamers set it up for the visitors, before Shadab Khan, despite not being at his best today, cleaned up the lower-order. This is also Pakistan's first ODI win in 2018.",Pakistan won by 201 runs, ODI,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,2
"Give this Pakistan some challenge. 194 was clearly short of one, and they've made sure they stay clinical in dusting it off. If it was Imam to anchor the innings in the first game, it's been all Fakhar Zaman today. He started with everything finding the middle of his bat and ended up in a struggle to get anything to connect cleanly. Nevertheless, he now has his highest ODI score and anchors another comprehensive chase. The Zimbabwean bowlers never gave themselves a chance, constantly being at the mercy of the attack the openers let out without anything on the board to attack after. But make no mistake, it's Pakistan's bowling that set it up .. Usman with his four-fer and pace, Hasan with his three-fer and more pace.",Pakistan won by 9 wkts, ODI ,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,3
"Happy faces in the Pakistan dressing room, handshakes all over. Despite the early hiccup, Fakhar Zaman and Babar Azam ensured that there was no more wobble in pursuit of a meagre 68. The Zimbabwean new ball bowlers - Blessing Muzarabani and Richard Ngarava - did show stomach for a fight, cranking it up. The duo of - Zaman and Azam - took their time, negated the threat and once they were settled, it was a mere stroll in the park. The target of 68 was never going to challenge Pakistan",Pakistan won by 9 wkts, ODI ,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,2
"Zimbabwe faced 256 deliveries in total and I'm pretty sure at least 150 of 'em are dots. When you're chasing 400 and play those many dot balls, you better be prepared for the inevitable. A listless performance overall from the hosts. They, however, can draw a couple of positives in skipper Hamilton Masakadza and Elton Chigumbura who both showed some intent to fight and that should give them a slight bit of confidence going into the fifth and final game of the series. ",Pakistan won by 244 runs, ODI,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,1
"That, most definitely, wasn't a run-chase. Zimbabwe made no effort to go for the target, they were happy to play out the fifty overs which they achieved, but it certainly didn't make for gripping TV. Pakistan's total of 364, set up by centuries from Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam, proved daunting enough to drain any sense of ambition out of the hosts. With that, they complete their 5-0 series sweep. Their top-order dominated with the bat right through, while the bowling was clinical all-round. Fielding still leaves a lot to be desired though, with catches going down for fun. ",Pakistan won by 131 runs, ODI,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,2
"Nepal lost their last nine wickets for just 49 runs. Chasing a target of 190, the visitors got off to a positive start - courtesy their openers Anil Sah and Gyanendra Malla - who were involved in a fifty partnership. Even after the former's downfall, Malla continued to play his shots and he became Nepal's first half-centurion in ODIs. Just when the skipper and Malla were threatening to take the match away from the hosts, the spin twins - Michael Rippon and Pieter Seelaar - changed the complexion of the match. The chase got derailed there and Nepal never recovered from there. Klaassen, Rippon and Seelaar all picked three wickets apiece. From 85/1, they got bundled out for 134.",Netherlands won by 55 runs, ODI ,Netherlands vs Nepal,3
"What a fantastic game of cricket. It went down right down the wire and it were Nepal who held their nerves in the final overs and managed to pull off a thrilling win. Wesley Barresi played a gem of a knock but Sandeep Lamichanne bowled a magical spell wherein he bagged three crucial wickets. The Dutch tail-enders took the game deep but it was the Nepal captain who got that all important run-out and helped Nepal notch up their first ever win in ODIs. Not to forget the fifties brought up by him and Sompal earlier in the day. So pivotal. Their fans would be happy as this marks a memorable day for them. Hopefully, first of many to come.",Nepal won by 1 run, ODI,Netherlands vs Nepal,5
"Afghanistan looked like they had lost their way towards the end of their innings, but the way their bowlers started, it was as if they had never lost any momentum at all. Mujeeb Ur Rahman started off with two wickets in two overs, and Rashid Khan followed up with three of his own later on. Aftab Alam and Fareed Ahmad filled into their roles nicely too, ensuring that Ireland never found a grip on the chase. They needed Stirling and Wilson, who were the only ones to have found any sort of rhythm at all, to kick on for longer than they did. Actually, not many Afghanistan batsmen found it easy to get going in the first half too. That's where Hazratullah Zazai's brilliant 74 off 33 balls made all the difference.",Afghanistan won by 16 runs - (Match reduced to 18 overs per-side due to rain), T20,Ireland vs Afghanistan,4
"This was a below-par batting performance from Ireland. The required rate was 8 RPO from the start, but the hosts lost three early wickets in the chase and never really recovered from there. Just two batsmen in double figures sums up the tale for Ireland - who were blown away by some immaculate bowling efforts from Afghanistan. Once the top-order was wrecked havoc by the pacers and Mujeeb, Rashid then wiped off the middle-order and tail in no time, finishing with a four-fer.",Afghanistan won by 81 runs, T20 ,Ireland vs Afghanistan,1
"Afghanistan have defended a modest total thanks to their powerful bowling attack. Almost 30 overs between Nabi, Mujeeb and Rashid choked the life out of the chase as run scoring became very tough which resulted in a couple of untimely run-outs. The fielding also was top-class and that ensured Ireland were floored in the first ODI. Earlier in the day, Gulbadin Naib and Shahidi got fifties before the visitors lost their way to end up with what looked like a below par total. But as they say it ain't over till it actually is over. Afghanistan go 1-0 up in the series and I feel Ireland has a lot of catching up to do. ",Afghanistan won by 29 runs, ODI,Ireland vs Afghanistan,3
"Excellent all-round effort by Simi Singh. Took a wicket and then kept his calm under pressure to steer his side home. Poterfield fell early in the chase, but Stirling and Balbirnie shared a 69-run stand for the second wicket to put Ireland on top. However, Mohammad Nabi and Rashid Khan put the brakes on the scoring with regular inroads. Simi Singh stayed put at one end and saw off some tough phases when the Afghan spinners were on top. Balbirnie played very well to ensure a good start for the hosts.",Ireland won by 3 wkts, ODI,Ireland vs Afghanistan,3
"A score of 124 from Ireland was never enough. Afghanistan did not even break a sweat to track this down. They lost Shahzad early but Janat and Rahmat Shah held fort. And after the break, Shahidi chipped in and helped Afghanistan track this total down. Ireland would be gutted given that they won the toss and decided to bat first. ",Afghanistan won by 8 wkts, ODI,Ireland vs Afghanistan,1
"After having Bangladesh on the mat - effectively 3 down for 3 runs - Sri Lanka tripped over with overexcitement and in the process dropped catches and let themselves down enabling a game-changing 131-run third wicket stand while at it. And from that instant, the momentum was firmly with Bangladesh who - led by the brilliance of Mushfiqur Rahim - ensured their valiant, gritty efforts with the bat didn't go in vain. They were pinpoint discipline with the ball and the fact that six of the ten Sri Lankan dismissals were either bowled or lbw adds substance to my conviction. In contrast, Sri Lanka only had two. ",Bangladesh won by 137 runs,ODI,Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka,3
"In these hot conditions, Pakistan hardly broke a sweat as they start off their campaign with a comprehensive win. They were excellent in all three departments of the game. It all started with a weird run-out - courtesy a Shadab Khan direct hit. There was just one substantial partnership in the Hong Kong innings - a half-century stand between Kinchit Shah and Aizaz Khan. Usman Khan came back in his second spell and scalped three wickets to bundle out Hong Kong for 116.",Pakistan won by 8 wkts, T20,Pakistan vs Hong Kong,2
"Afghanistan have another scalp in their ever-growing kitty. They've beaten Sri Lanka for the first time in ODI cricket, and with it, they go through to the Super Fours along with Bangladesh while Sri Lanka go home. Can this really be called an upset? Especially after following their staggering growth over the last couple of years. And especially against this Sri Lankan team which looks so defeated, what with the dropped catches and the run-outs. I'm not so sure. There were only three successful run-chases of 250-plus at Abu Dhabi before today (out of 19), and Sri Lanka never looked like being the fourth. They lost a wicket second ball, they threw away budding partnerships to atrocious run-outs, and they never looked comfortable against spin. Their ODI form has really gone down the drain in the last couple of years and this tournament just encapsulates their miseries.",Afghanistan won by 91 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Afghanistan,3
"India have managed to get out of a self-made maze. They huffed and puffed for a major part of it but held their nerves when it mattered the most to win by 26 runs. It was about the tail-spin! India fluffed their chance of getting beyond 300 by adding only 48 in their last 10 and Hong Kong ran out of fuel when the finish line was at the next bend. Erstwhile, India settled for only 285 despite a Shikhar Dhawan special. They lost too many wickets in the end and even then everyone thought how quickly would India finish it off. But all and sundry were in for a humble pie treat from Hong Kong. An opening partnership of 174 runs from Nizakat Khan(92) and Anshuman Rath(73) ensured India had to pinch themselves out of the nightmare. And once awake, the latex-laden wrists of Kuldeep and Chahal took over. Their 20 overs together went for 88 and more importantly scalped 5 wickets. But that was not it. The debutant - Khaleel Ahmed - might have been an obscure name, not anymore. His spirited spells after the 35-over mark tilted the beam hugely in India's favor as well.",India won by 26 runs,ODI,India vs Hong Kong,4
"For all the hype, a damp squib in the end, a rather one-sided contest dominated totally by the Indians. The only time Pakistan seemed to compete was when Malik and Babar were repairing the damage after the early loss of the openers. Once that partnership was broken, Pakistan were never really in the game. 162 was never going to be enough and any slim hope that they had was snuffed out by the Indian openers who put on a rollicking stand. Rohit was in his elements with a free stroking fifty while Dhawan also looked in fabulous touch. The duo couldn't see off the game but had done the damage and the Rayudu-Karthik pair duly finished off the formalities with 21 overs left. A proper thrashing indeed. Pakistan would rue their poor shot selection in the batting that cost them dear, probably were too eager to dominate on a pitch that wasn't easy to play shots. Also, the track did play better under lights, as it did during the India-Hong Kong game, which begs the question whether Sarfraz erred at the toss.",India won by 8 wkts,ODI,"India vs Pakistan,",3
"What a day for Rashid Khan. He turned 20 today. Blasted a 31-ball fifty to propel Afghanistan to a good total, then bagged two wickets for almost nothing and then effected a brilliant run-out as well. More importantly, a great game for Afghanistan. Mind you, in the evening, Bangladesh were bossing the game. Their bowlers were very disciplined and the Afghan top-order found the going very tough. Shahidi held one end tight, but it was that 95-run partnership off 55 balls between Naib and Rashid that proved to be the game changer.",Afghanistan won by 136 runs,ODI,Bangladesh vs Afghanistan,3
"Rohit Sharma has a bright smile on his face. That sums up the performance of his side in this match. It was a walk in the park for the Indians. The comeback man Jadeja did all the damage in the first innings. And Bangladesh never recovered from there. Mehidy Hasan and Mortaza guided them to a respectable total but 170 odd runs on the board will never challenge this Indian batting line-up. Rohit and Shikhar got India off to a perfect start and Bangladesh never looked like defending it. Dhawan and Rayudu parted ways with Rohit after getting starts. Dhoni was promoted to number 4 and he looked in his element at the crease, while trying to to finish it with a six, he got out to Mortaza. Karthik joined Rohit and they eased India to victory. ",India won by 7 wkts,ODI,India vs Bangladesh,3
" If that doesn't define you the ease at which India have gone about things today, I'm afraid nothing else will. Momentum, they say, is a vital factor in sport and India once again exemplified why the phrase is so over-hyped and overused. They've pulled things back with the ball in the final 8 overs (44/3) and never looked back since. Although the conditions showed a bit of allegiance to the side batting second, Rohit and Dhawan - make no mistake - took nothing for granted; they respected good deliveries and pounced on the bad ones to put the chase on a platter. Both engineered a 210-run opening stand asides from their magnificent hundreds ",India won by 9 wkts,ODI,"India vs Pakistan,",4
"The pressure was always on Afghanistan as they were chasing for the first time in the tournament. They did not get off to a good start - losing Ihsanullah Janat and Rahmat Shah early. Mohammad Shahzad played a weird innings, one where he looked comfortable and not. However, his partnership with Shahidi steadied the innings and set it up. There was another stand between Asghar Afghan and Shahidi that gave further hope, but when the asking rate touched 10 it started getting tough. Mortaza rotated his bowlers around smartly and though his strike bowlers - Shakib and Mustafizur didn't finish their quota, they were used in the right manner and right time.",Bangladesh won by 3 runs,ODI,Afghanistan vs Bangladesh,3
"The scorecards of Pakistan and Bangladesh look eerily similar. Five double-digit scores and the rest...um! A total bummer. Needing 240, Pakistan - much like Bangladesh - blew themselves up in the face at the start by losing three key wickets inside five overs. And when Malik walked in to join Imam-Ul-Haq a ray of hope emerged expecting revival of sorts, but as they so often say: A moment of brilliance in the field can upend momentum and that's what skipper Mortaza did to Pakistan. Plucked out a bonzer of a catch to dismiss Malik, and although Asif Ali, along with Imam, reignited a comeback, the strangle applied by the Bangladeshi spinners proved to be too good against the inexperience of Pakistan's lower middle-order. Gotta feel for Junaid Khan and young Imam-Ul-Haq, the duo played out of their skins with ball and bat respectively but got very little, or perhaps, no support from the others to back up their commendable efforts.",Bangladesh won by 37 runs,ODI,Pakistan vs Bangladesh,4
" India have won, but they've been made to work for it. The fans don't have any fingernails left - a billion of them. Jadhav hasn't been allowed to take off his pads and is rushed into an interview by KP. Kuldeep is out there as well. And how good was he? Cool as a cucumber. Blood, sweat, tears and ecstasy - What a finale. Kedar ""Hamstrung"" Jadhav has done it again, on one leg, and for India this time. It took a few vital innings in the middle-order, including a stabilizing partnership between Dhoni and Karthik, and a few cameos, to edge them closer - and the lusty blows by Bhuvi at the end seriously eased it out for Jadhav's heroics in the final frame of the finale.",India won by 3 wkts,ODI ,India vs Bangladesh,5
"A thumping victory for Pakistan. They have vindicated their number 1 ranking in this format. Australia were favorites at the start of the chase. But Imad Wasim, making a comeback in international cricket was at his very best and he picked up three wickets in his first spell. His bowling partner, Faheem Ashraf picked up 2 and Australia were 6 six down within the powerplay. None of the Australian batsmen showed application and match was literally over in the first five overs of the chase. Ashton Agar and Nathan Coulter-Nile forged a partnership of 38 runs to provide some respectability to the total. But they could not save Australia from the embarrassment of a massive defeat. ",Pakistan won by 66 runs, T20,Pakistan vs Australia,3
"Top intensity from Pakistan with the ball and that has helped them nip out a victory by 11 runs to take the T20I series. Barring the couple of dropped chances, Pakistan were clinical in their defence of 147. 10th series in a row for Pakistan. They are the rulers of this format and put in another display to just corroborate the fact. Sarf gets a big hug from his coach and has held a stump in his hand as a souvenir. He is chuffed to bits and rightly so. Maxwell looks despondent and sinks his face into his hands. Australia earlier had done exceedingly well to restrict Pakistan to 147 with NCN being the pick of the bowlers. Pakistan though triggered another early collapse which also included a controversial run-out call of Short, who seemed to have his bat down on to the ground but despite that the third umpire ruled him out.",Pakistan won by 11 runs, T20,Pakistan vs Australia,4
"This was expected. The writing was on the wall, you can say, even before the game began. It read WHITEWASH. And Pakistan have just completed the formalities without really breaking a lot of sweat. Like the previous games, Pakistan settled for a par score despite threatening to get much more. 150 looked enough for this well-oiled and versatile bowling unit of Pakistan but 20 runs off the first over meant Pakistani plans were put off a bit. The newly promoted Alex Carey though could not carry on beyond that and the chase derailed once again. Ben McDermott, run out for the third time, looked good but again flattered to deceive and so did Mitch Marsh. Coach Mickey Arthur had a huge smile, almost beaming like a bulb, on his face as he walked down to shake hands. His boys indeed had done their homework well. Australia sadly will have nothing to show for on this tour barring the stalemate in the first Test. ",Pakistan won by 33 runs, T20 ,Pakistan vs Australia,3
"Turns out to be a cake walk for India. A loss such as this can really be hard on you. Windies got to be mentally really strong to leave this behind and come back better in Vizag. But how did India make 323 look like 223? Lovely pitch to bat on, true bounce, a bit like the Wankhede and what do batsmen do in run chases there? Swing through the line without a seed of doubt about the two-paced nature of a cricket pitch and collect runs at will. That is exactly what happened today.",India won by 8 wkts, ODI,India vs Windies,4
"When India posted 321 on what seemed like a tricky pitch, everyone thought ah! Kuldeep will chew them up, Chahal might get a six-fer. All those sorts of theories, I'm sure, made rounds across most parts of the globe, but the Windies had different plans. They put up a real royal-rumble of a fight and never gave up till the last minute. It was all set up by a 143-run (off 119 balls) stand between Shai Hope and Shimron Hetmyer who aced the Indian spinners at will to keep the required run rate under check. And when the usual moment of panic set in, Hope stood tall like a shining light and gave his all to remain undefeated till the final delivery; towards the end, just when things swung India's way - wicket off Nurse - Hope pounced on the tiniest of hopes that India and Umesh, and perhaps Rayudu offered. The best part of the game has to be the spirit that the players displayed. Dhoni and Kohli were all smiles moments after the finish and laughed it off tapping each others shoulder.",Match tied, ODI,India vs Windies,5
"The tragedy waiting to happen in the last game has struck India, finally. There were a few reasons which contributed to a rare loss at home. Firstly, Kohli got it wrong at the toss. There was more bite for the spinners in the second half. Secondly, only five batsmen and a keeper ensured Bhuvneshwar was batting at seven! Thirdly, India's inabilty to clean up the the lower-order for the third successive time in the series. Windies were 227 for 8 and India allowed them to get to 283. And lastly, Windies have been by far one of the most competitive tourists, in white ball cricket, that India have hosted in the near future. India's first loss in 9 ODIs which includes a couple of tied affairs.",Windies won by 43 runs, ODI,India vs Windies,3
" Wow, what a no-contest. The anti-climax to trump (I still can't believe he's pres... never mind) all others. The parternship between Rohit and Rayudu didn't exactly make the bowler's anxious, as they came out all guns blazing. Bhuvneshwar picked up the first wicket for India, before 2 fantastic direct-hits by Kuldeep and Kohli dented the Windies top order and potentially increased their margin of defeat by a good 100 runs. Khaleel Ahmed rattled the middle-order with some excellent swing bowling before the mystery of Kuldeep and the nagging accuracy of Jadeja helped clean up the tail. India could have been more clinical with the tail, but Roach and Holder showed some good resistance at the end to make India stay in the field longer than they'd've liked before Kuldeep finished it off with his third. In the end, the Windies fell short of Rohit Sharma's individual score by 9 runs.",India won by 224 runs, ODI,India vs Windies,3
"This was supposed to be a Day-Night affair but the sun hasn't even gone down in Thiruvananthapuram and India's celebrations have begun already. They've made rather short work of the Windies today, with the match lasting all of 46.4 overs. It's a shame it had to finish this way. Windies, competitive in the earlier half, ran out of gas apparently in the last couple of games. Their decision to bat first today was questionable, considering the conditions were overcast, the pitch a little damp and dew was expected to set in later on. India's pacers found swing, their spinners got the ball to grip and they rolled over the opposition for just 104. That was the end of the contest, although Rohit Sharma did have some fun for himself later on with Virat Kohli happy to take the back seat.",India won by 9 wkts, ODI,India vs Windies,2
"Krunal Pandya's had an excellent outing on debut, and he gets to hit the winning runs. He's visibly pleased. India were made to sweat a bit, a little more than you'd expect them to while chasing something like 110, but they've got there in reasonable health with a couple of overs left. This was a pitch which offered some juice to the bowlers, which Oshane Thomas in particular exploited very well with the new ball to produce some thrilling deliveries - especially that ball with which he removed Dhawan. India slumped to 45/4 at one point, but Dinesh Karthik settled in nicely to ensure that the job was done. Maybe a few more runs could've made it interesting. But the Windies were badly let down by their batsmen early on. They probably aimed too high for a pitch that didn't need as much effort, only to fall down with a crash. ",India won by 5 wkts, T20,India vs Windies,3
"A stroll in the park for India as they take an unassailable 2-0 lead in this 3-match T20I series. The world champions have suffered another defeat, another huge defeat. After a certain boy from Mumbai set the new stadium in Lucknow on fire, this was bound to happen. With his brilliant knock of 111* - Rohit Sharma set the tone for India. It was not going to be an easy wicket to bat on and it was definitely not going to be easy to clear those big boundaries. But who likes easy? Rohit Sharma? Na ... he doesn't. Being certified as the cleanest hitter of the cricket ball in modern day cricket - he along with Dhawan set the stage for the final assault. With that kind of a first innings score, the bowlers had plenty to defend. All of them chipped in with wickets and Krunal Pandya didn't miss out on the chance too. Although he wasn't able to get any wicket, he came to the party with a direct-hit. And courtesy of this clinical performance, India have managed to clinch the series.",India won by 71 runs, T20,India vs Windies,4
"What a game we've witnessed today! India had it in their grasp, but the thrill-seeking middle-order that represents a billion has managed to take it to the last ball for the second time in a couple of months. A fantastic batting effort by the Windies, capped off by some excellent hitting at the death, particularly by Pooran, exposing an Achilles' heel in India's Bumrah-less bowling line-up. The early wicket of Rohit Sharma handed Windies the initiative early, but a risky-but-effective counterattacking innings by Pant and a composed and aggressive knock by Dhawan made sure India were always going to cross the line - until the last 2 overs. Pant, after a stunning knock, tried a silly shot and lost his middle-stump and Keemo Paul bowled a fantastic penultimate over and Dhawan, after a stupendous innings, lost his wicket in a tight, alarming final over that nearly wiped the smiles off Indian faces. It was all possible until the final ball, when a misfield by the bowler cost them the match. A fantastic nail-biter to cap off a rather one-sided tour...
