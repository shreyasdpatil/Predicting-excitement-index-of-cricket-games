The tail fell apart and the visitors completed a crushing victory, neg
The SA bowlers were good but were defending a total which was under par,neg
New Zealand will rue the batting collapse that took place in the batting powerplay,neg
Nicol dropped him once while Ryder dropped Duminy,neg
"Nethula impressed with two wickets but in the end, Brendon McCullum had a poor score to defend.",neg
"They got off to a poor start and the middle order failed again in the face of some hostile bowling from Steyn, de Lange and Peterson",neg
New Zealand made a fight of it towards the end but the result was never in doubt,neg
"After C Obuya got out, they missed the trick and lost wickets at regular intervals to lose the match by a narrow margin",neg
Shakib Al Hasan then battled until the end but his partners deserted him and he had to fight as the lone ranger for his team,neg
"Sri Lanka failed to put up a challenging total on the board and despite making a few early inroads, the total was just not enough",neg
Canada will find it very difficult to lift themselves up after this loss.,neg
Namibia were never in the game and the 2nd innings was just a mere formality for the Irish who certainly deserved their place in the mega event set to be held in September,neg
"The Irish seemed well on course to canter home, but wickets off successive balls by that man - Zadran again reignited Afghanistan's hopes",neg
"After losing 3 early wickets Samuels and Dwayne Bravo put together an important stand of 64 for the 4th wicket, but Christian provided the much needed breathrough by removing Bravo and rest of the batsmen soon followed him by playing some loose shots",neg
"Sammy showed some fight towards the end, but he had ran out of partners and he was the last batsman to get out.",neg
Powell fell early and the top order got starts,neg
The top order collapsed in the phase of some disciplined bowling by Watson and Doherty,neg
"However, they lost wickets towards the end as the pressure mounted",neg
"Narine was the pick of the bowlers as he went for just 21 runs in 4 overs, but could not pick any wickets",neg
"However, some brilliant fielding from Dwayne Bravo resulted in Warner being run-out and West Indies came back in the game",neg
"Today's match saw fireworks from the South African batsmen and just when the Indian batsmen, especially Gambhir, were beginning to display theirs, rain dampened them out",neg
"Unfortunately, rain had the final laugh, and it meant that South Africa won the game",neg
"Chasing 288 was tough and West Indies needed one batsman to score big, but that didn't happen even though Smith started off aggressively and got to a quickfire fifty",neg
None of the other batsmen supported him well and rain arrived to stop the game,neg
"Upon resumption, Samuels started off well with some big hits, but they soon lost wickets in a heap and folded up cheaply",neg
Darren Bravo also came down the order because of a groin injury and that didn't help their cause,neg
"West Indies never seemed to be in the game, even when Dwayne Bravo, Keiron Pollard and Darren Sammy scored some quick runs in their batting powerplay",neg
"Narine failed to inspire once again and the rest of the bowlers, save for Best, looked flat throughout the day",neg
This is now the lowest T20 total in Sri Lanka,neg
Pakistan's batting was all over the place and none of the batsmen looked very comfortable against the short delivery,neg
Ahmed Shehzad finished up as the highest scorer amongst both teams but his innings of 36 came at a snail's pace and lasted 42 balls,neg
Yet again Pakistan have bowled well but haven't finished up on top owing to some poor shot selection,neg
This match also will be remembered as one of the longest matches played as it was interrupted thrice by rain today and not many overs were reduced,neg
Sri Lanka's batting let them down and they will hope to put up a much better performance in the next ODI.,neg
"Pakistan looked to be in the game when Misbah and Azhar Ali were batting in the middle, but once the skipper fell, the other batsmen followed him back to the pavilion",neg
"After Umar Akmal had to return back thanks to a horrendous decision, the onus was on Afridi to take his side home",neg
"But unfortunately for them, the batting powerplay turned out to be a nightmare as they lost Misbah and then Umar Akmal during that passage of play",neg
It only went from bad to worse as Thissara Perera proceeded to pick a hat-trick in the 41st over and Pakistan collapsed from 166/2 to 199 all out,neg
Sri Lanka stuttered in their chase early as they lost their openers without doing much damage,neg
Then Sanga and Chandimal stitched a partnership and they found it hard to negotiate the spinners in the middle overs,neg
They were also pretty ordinary in the field and too many runs were conceded as a result of which Sri Lankans got away when they needed runs,neg
Ashraful played some good strokes but he played a loose shot and was dismissed,neg
The middle order failed to put up much of a fight,neg
The South Africans were a bit off the boil in the final overs and they will look to overcome that.,neg
"However, in the end, it was a bridge too far for South Africa and they have suffered defeat by 29 runs.",neg
"Gary Kirsten and Allan Donald will have some work, SA did miss some of their stars but their efforts were patchy in this tournament.",neg
It is indeed very disappointing,neg
"Over the past couple of days in the UK, two international matches have been abandoned",neg
"In the end, the rain killed off any chances of further play.",neg
"After they were put in by Australia, they got off to a solid start, but lost quick wickets in the middle",neg
"Wade was playing well for his 27, but a terrible mix-up in the middle cut short his innings and that was the last nail in the coffin for Australia.",neg
Clint McKay bowled with a lot of heart but he found no support from the other bowlers,neg
"Australia were never in the game, and to make it worse, suffered a couple of injury blows too (Watson and Lee)",neg
Nicol tried to be aggressive but he had no support from the other batsmen,neg
Taylor retired hurt on 10 to give New Zealand more anxious moments,neg
"Oram provided a flourish towards the end but in the end, it was a bridge too far for the Kiwis as they lost the match by 56 runs.",neg
New Zealand were never in the game after Narine rattled them early on,neg
New Zealand looked down and out from the first ball and they will have to ask some really tough questions.,neg
The Kiwi bowlers lacked intensity and failed to create pressure.,neg
Guptill started things off on a positive note by getting to his half century but couldn't convert it into a big innings,neg
Williamson and Watling also got half centuries but the lack of support and the lack of quick runs found New Zealand short of the target,neg
"However, there was no support from the other end and in the end New Zealand succumbed to a 24 run defeat",neg
"Only Taylor and Williamson played well, but they didn't get much support from the other end.",neg
"Canada's bowlers and fielders looked quite jaded for most parts of the match, perhaps they couldn't get over the fact that they were actually finally playing a game.",neg
But they were blown away by Nowroz Mangal,neg
The lack of bowling discipline from the Scots cost them in the end,neg
"Kyle Coetzer's fine 133 went in vain, his 1st century at this level.",neg
The match went into the reserve day as most part of yesterday was washed out due to rain,neg
"The play was interrupted again due to rain today and in the end, Scotland who were ahead according to D/L method had to get around 33 runs in less than 7 overs to gain crucial 2 points.",neg
"In the end, the Dutch could not hold on and crumbled against the Irish pace.",neg
Ireland kept the required rate under check for most parts of the chase but couldn't quite finish it off,neg
"Stirling, Joyce and Wilson got starts but at least one of them should have carried on and seen them through.",neg
The pitch was always expected to take turn under the lights and even the part time SA spinners got vicious turn and English batsmen had no answer to that and lost wickets in a heap,neg
"Only Morgan fought a hard battle, but he didn't get any support from the other end",neg
"Samit entertained the crowds with a stroke-filled 45, but that was not enough for them to get anywhere close to the SA total.",neg
The bowling barring Steyn was lacklustre,neg
England got a few early wickets but they could not break this unbeaten 90 run stand,neg
Dernbach and Finn were the pick of the bowlers but no one else supported them.,neg
They were sent into bat after the match was reduced to 11 overs due to rain,neg
Swann and Briggs got the ball to turn viciously and the Proteas never got going,neg
Even their run machine Amla couldn't get the odd boundaries regularly,neg
But overall a poor performance from the Proteas in this series,neg
"But, in the end, the asking rate was too much and Sri Lanka were always behind the eight ball",neg
"Barring Irfan Pathan and Ashwin who bowled well, all the other Indian bowlers were carted around",neg
The Indian fielding was also very sloppy and they have a lot of work to do ahead of the second ODI.,neg
"Manoj Tiwary and Kohli then put on a partnership of 49, before Jeevan Mendis got a brave lbw decision in his favour to dismiss Tiwary",neg
Shakib got out a little early and for a moment the Dutch would have felt that they could stage a come back but those hopes were washed away by a sparkling cameo from Rahim,neg
They recovered to post 128 but that didn't prove to be enough,neg
MS Dhoni will come in for much criticism,neg
They were bowled out for their second lowest score in T20Is and were never in a position to challenge Pakistan after that,neg
This is their biggest loss in terms of balls to spare.,neg
Just three Pakistani batsmen crossed into double figures and none of the three scored at faster than a run a ball,neg
The Zimbabwe batsmen failed to negotiate these two and they capitulated tamely,neg
"Shahzad, Mangal and Sadiq got off to starts but none could convert it",neg
They were never in the contest once Tamim and Shakib departed cheaply,neg
Nasir Hossain hung in there and scored a gritty fifty but he did not get support,neg
Sri Lanka were never in the match after T Dilshan was run out without facing a ball,neg
Dilshan Munaweera looked ill at ease and failed to score freely,neg
Nobody in the Lankan line-up could play a knock like the one played by de Villiers which ultimately made the difference,neg
"Levi and du Plessis failed once again, while their high catching in this game has been pathetic.",neg
"Taylor, Franklin and Oram struck some late blows but they were left with too much to do in the end",neg
It was a dismal performance with the ball from Bangladesh,neg
"They showed a lot of spirit with the bat, Shakib led the way there but there was no one to do a similar role with the ball",neg
The pacers were guilty of bowling too many short deliveries,neg
He has scored an unbeaten 71 off just 36 balls but even that was not enough to take England past the line,neg
It was all because of the horror start they got - Rampaul started with a double wicket maiden and England took their own sweet time to rebuild,neg
Bairstow in particular struggled to get going and that kept pushing up the required run rate,neg
"Hales and Morgan kept trying, and with some luck going their way, even put some pressure on West Indies, but the target was always beyond their reach.",neg
"So, for the third time in a row, South Africa have been unable to defeat Pakistan in the T20 Cup",neg
"After a brisk start, Pakistan lost three wickets quickly and they continued to lose wickets in the middle overs",neg
"Samit Patel was the lone batsman to show some fight with a spunky 67, Swann threatened to upset West Indies with a fine cameo but it was too little and too late.",neg
"Pakistan never looked like they would come anywhere close to the target, Nazir gave them a decent start but the middle order struggled as the spinners came on",neg
The death blow was the twin dismissals of skipper Hafeez and the woefully out of form Afridi,neg
Umar Akmal fought well but neither he nor Umar Gul could do little to snatch victory.,neg
Australia never got going and they were restricted to 43/6,neg
"However, the asking rate was too much as Australia suffered a 74 run defeat",neg
It became even more difficult after they lost some quick wickets early on,neg
They were totally outclassed and will have to forget this game before the next one.,neg
"West Indies were never in the chase right from the first ball, they lost their openers very early and never recovered from there on",neg
The match was over and only a fighting 56 from Mahmudullah delayed the final outcome.,neg
The Bangladesh batting collapsed again as Roach ripped through the top order,neg
At least 10 full tosses were wasted and Bangladesh have been made to pay for that,neg
Bangladesh will look back at the game and reckon that the last over from Rubel Hossain where he conceded 29 runs was the turning point.,neg
England were never in the game after they lost a flurry of wickets post a strong start,neg
The fact that India's batsmen came out attacking made things difficult for them as well,neg
India will look back at the last two overs which went for 38 runs,neg
"Yuvraj and Raina played gorgeous strokes, but got out at crucial junctures",neg
"Dhoni got the crowd going with 4 sixes, but hit one straight to the fielder",neg
Indeed that was the story of the innings as most of the batsmen gifted away their wickets,neg
The England chase never really got going,neg
"He played a lot of wonderful strokes and missed out on a well-deserved hundred, courtesy a poor decision",neg
"Except Finn, all the bowlers were expensive which did not help.",neg
"Ishant Sharma, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar and Ravindra Jadeja were impressive but the score was just not big enough to defend",neg
Chandimal fought bravely for his 73 but got zero support at the other end,neg
Kushal Perera and Dilshan started the chase off well but they stuttered when the spinners came on to bowl,neg
Glenn Maxwell hit consecutive fours and threatened to take the game away but he couldn't quite finish on a high.,neg
The visitors never really arrived for the game,neg
"The batting was a huge let down and even though the bowlers showed some spirit, it was never going to be enough",neg
The wet ball made it even more difficult for the Protea bowlers but they missed a few chances as well,neg
The visitors were never in the chase after Guptill and Brendon McCullum got out,neg
Franklin was probably their last hope but even he did not inspire any confidence,neg
New Zealand got off to a horrid start as the top order once again capitulated,neg
"However, in the middle overs, they once again stuttered before Nathan McCullum played a nice cameo",neg
But it has to be said that it was South Africa's match to lose,neg
"But thanks to 5 run outs, they eventually fell 27 run short",neg
Smith led the chase with a century but wickets kept falling around him,neg
"South Africa looked safe until Smith was there but once he went, New Zealand pounced on the opportunity",neg
Pakistan started off well and were kept in the hunt by some exceptional batting from their skipper Hafeez but Dinda ensured that India didn't have to worry by taking care of three crucial wickets.,neg
They would lay some blame on a crucial umpiring error when Jamshed was adjudged not out on 24,neg
Ashwin was guilty of overstepping and missed out on a wicket in the process,neg
Yuvraj dropped Jamshed on 68,neg
Umesh and Zaheer didn't get much out of the track but they troubled the batsmen with reverse swing,neg
He played a marathon knock but it wasn't enough to save the game.,neg
A straightforward win for the hosts despite missing many of their batting stars,neg
"The bowlers then stood up, Tharanga and Mahela were dismissed cheaply, Dilshan and Chandimal steadied the ship before the calamitous run-out of Dilshan started the slide",neg
Chandimal fought bravely for his 73 but got zero support at the other end.,neg
It was a hard fought match but Sri Lanka came up well short,neg
Sri Lanka never had one batsman to hold an end up,neg
Mahela Jayawardene promised much but fell too quickly,neg
Mathews waged a lone battle for some time but it was not enough,neg
It was definitely harder to bat as the game progressed,neg
"The South African bowlers toiled hard, but were let down by the batsmen as well as a wet ball.",neg
"Pakistan fought well throughout their innings but were just not good enough on the day, maybe a couple of more wickets in hand could have got them past the line",neg
Wahab Riaz batted really well but ran out of partners as Dale Steyn led the Proteas bowling line up with good support from the rest of the bowlers,neg
The bowlers fought hard but were let down by a below par score and their own profligacy with the extras,neg
West Indies just didn't turn up today,neg
The duo added 126 runs for the 4th wicket but the visitors collapsed once Powell fell.,neg
"Gayle failed, Pollard was run out, and that left a bit too much for the likes of Russell and Sammy",neg
Johnson Charles' streaky 100 and Pollard's watchful innings gave them hope but neither could last till the end.,neg
"That was the case here as well as New Zealand, though for a brief moment looked like they were in the hunt, could never really build solid partnerships",neg
"England never looked in the game and struggled against the pace, bounce and swing of the pacers",neg
Ian Bell started off well but fell in the pursuit of quick runs,neg
Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott shared a steady 67 run stand before Tim Southee sent both Trott and Cook back,neg
"For New Zealand, only Southee and Andrew Ellis bowled well but the rest of the bowling lacked penetration.",neg
"Zimbabwe were never really in the hunt, their top-order was blown away very quickly and ever since then there was no recovery from them even though malcolm Waller registered his 4th ODI fifty",neg
"Mutombodzi and Mushangwe bowled well for Zimbabwe, but they didn't have a good total to defend.",neg
"Chasing a revised target of 183, Bangladesh got off to a good start, but soon lost wickets in a heap",neg
"Sri Lanka fought hard, but the efforts of Malinga and Senanayake was not enough in the end to bring them back into the game.",neg
Some tight bowling towards the end by the Sri Lankan bowlers made it difficult for Bangladesh and they fell short by 17 runs.,neg
"Bangladeshi seamers bowled a tight line and length to rip through the Zimbabwean top order, with only Taylor and Masakadza brothers offering some resistance",neg
They bowled well initially as they were boltered by the addition of Vitori,neg
He gave them a good start and struck twice in 2 balls to leave Bangladesh struggling,neg
"Zimbabwe started the chase in an aggressive fashion, but lost Masakadza and Taylor in quick succession",neg
But one over from Utseya changed it all and it all went downhill from there,neg
"They kept losing wickets at regular intervals, Mushfiqur had almost carried them home but he was caught off the first ball of the final over and it was all over for the visitors.",neg
Zimbabwe kept losing wickets at regular intervals and never really looked in control of the game,neg
England never looked like they would chase this score down,neg
"Only Trott stood amongst the ruins and compiled a century, but the match was lost way before that",neg
"Guptill started off on a positive note, but the visitors suddenly lost track of their chase",neg
"In the end, it was too much for Taylor as he ran out of partners",neg
There were lots of stoppages due to rain in the 1st innings and the match was reduced to 47 overs,neg
"Pakistani bowling was horrible and even their experienced spinner, Ajmal went for 71 runs in his 10 overs.",neg
India showed no intent whatsoever in this chase,neg
"By the end of 10 overs, India were crawling around at a run-rate just under three",neg
They kept on losing wickets and only Ravindra Jadeja showed some character with an unbeaten 49,neg
West Indies were already on the back foot when the rain delay shelved some overs off,neg
"Chasing 274 for an unlikely win and 219 to deny India the bonus point, Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma ripped through the middle order",neg
"However, once he departed, India struggled to gain momentum",neg
"If one thought Pakistan batted very badly, the West Indies reply was even poor",neg
None of the batsmen got going and eventually they succumbed to pressure,neg
Pakistan were never really allowed to be free,neg
Nasir Jamshed was given 4 lives but he could not make the most of it,neg
"One thought Pakistan pulled off a fine win but they were denied by Holder and more importantly, Umar Akmal himself",neg
"They lost Gayle, Charles and Darren Bravo early",neg
"Pressure got the better of Dwayne Bravo, Pollard and Sammy who went in quick succession",neg
Holder held his nerve and hit a boundary and then a stunning six before Akmal grabbed attention on the final ball by missing a relatively easy run-out.,neg
Pakistan kept a healthy scoring rate but lost wickets at regular intervals,neg
,neg
Gabriel's erratic bowling in the 19th over has proven to be very costly for the West Indies.,neg
The Lankans were brilliant as the visitors never really got going from the start,neg
But some clever bowling by the spinners out-foxed them and they began losing wickets at regular intervals,neg
The injury to Hashim Amla already jolted South Africa's batting line-up,neg
"The bowlers made sure that Sri Lanka struggled in the chase, Tsotsobe struck thrice in no time to reduce them to 16/3",neg
"Mahela and Chandimal added useful runs but when they were reduced to 92/6, it looked all but over",neg
South Africa did not go for a review when Duminy trapped Sangakkara plumb in front very early in the piece and they paid a heavy price for it,neg
"With the series lost, they came out firing and put the South African players under huge pressure",neg
The openers got starts but failed to build on,neg
"Kohli and Raina fell towards the end, but the match was all but decided by then",neg
Vusi Sibanda and Hamilton Masakadza started confidently but once these two fell the innings just fell apart,neg
Zimbabwe lost wickets at regular intervals and never got going,neg
Cheteshwar Pujara failed to make the most of his opportunity at the top of the order as he was bowled by Chatara for just 13,neg
"After a fine start given by Dhawan, Jadeja slowed things for a while before accelerating alongside Rahane",neg
Zimbabwe will be really unhappy with their show in the series.,neg
"But, Anwar Ali trapped Masakadza in the 8th over and it all went downhill from there",neg
Taylor's fightback at one end was not enought as they needed 32 off the final over,neg
The hosts started off well but stumbled in the middle overs as the Pakistani spinners stole the day,neg
Last time they won a match against Pakistan in ODIs was way back in 1998,neg
Masakadza gave them a fantastic start and was unlucky to miss out on a century as he got out for 85,neg
A late collapse hurt the Zimbabweans,neg
They were put into bat and they struggled hard to reach a decent total,neg
"Zimbabwe started their chase pretty well, but lost back to back wickets of Masakadza and Taylor in quick sucession, which dented their hopes",neg
Almost all Pakistani bowlers chipped in with wickets and Zimbabwe never really looked like chasing down the total.,neg
"Chasing 249 was always a tough ask, but England started the chase on a perfect note, but lost 3 wickets in space of 2 overs which derailed their chase",neg
,neg
"It was a tough chase for the visitors, they lost Finch and Watson early",neg
"Warner led the chase with a spirited half century, but it all went downhill once he was dismissed",neg
"Maxwell did his best towards the end, but it was always a steep chase",neg
Chasing 362 was always a tough ask,neg
Australian bowlers struck at regular intervals to make matter even worse for Scotland,neg
"Only Pietersen, Morgan and Buttler excelled with the bat, with rest of the batsmen falling to some poor strokes.",neg
It was tough going for Morgan and Carberry as they looked to rebuild the innings,neg
The 104-run stand was broken by Watson who accounted for Morgan,neg
"For Australia, this is their fourth loss in five ODIs at this venue.",neg
Australia have some silverware to take home at the end of their long English summer,neg
The England batsman never really got going and lost early wickets,neg
They were in the hunt until Bopara and Buttler shared a fine partnership but the batting powerplay helped Australia as both were dismissed in quick succession,neg
The tail wagged for a while but they had too much to do and eventually were bowled out 49 runs short,neg
"The New Zealand bowlers were finding it difficult to get regular wickets, they could not get an early wicket and were under pressure most of the time during the run chase",neg
"The jinx continues for New Zealand, they have now been whitewashed twice in three years.",neg
Bangladesh's poor record in T20Is continues as they slump to their 7th loss in 8 games,neg
He was well supported by Naeem and Nasir but pressure got the better of them as they lost wickets at regular intervals,neg
"But in the end, the vistors held their nerve and now they will not be going home empty handed.",neg
India were set a challenging target and they lost Rohit early,neg
Raina and Dhawan gave them a good start in the powerplay until both were dismissed,neg
Kohli threw his wicket away after getting a start,neg
India were off to a bad start losing Dhawan very early,neg
"Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina, all started well but failed to convert it into bigger knocks",neg
Dhoni failed for once and the lower order capitulated in the face of the mounting run-rate,neg
"Rohit missed out on his ton, dismissed by a rank half-tracker from Finch",neg
"He continued with the form he showed in Jaipur as the target came down with every over, Dhawan was dismissed shortly after his hundred and India suffered a minor hiccup when the two out of form batsmen, Yuvraj Singh and Raina were dismissed in a Johnson over.*",neg
South Africa never really got going,neg
They kept losing wickets at regular intervals and none of the batsmen really got in,neg
They struggled to get the spinners away,neg
All the three spinners created all sorts of problems,neg
Some of the batsmen got starts but no one went on to get a big one,neg
There is lot to think about for Pakistan as their batsmen let them down again,neg
"Most of them got starts, but threw their wickets away",neg
The partnership between Riaz and Tanvir looked promising but it was too late.,neg
Once again Pakistan have handed the match on a platter to South Africa from a winning position,neg
"He even stitched an fruitful stand with Misbah, but his wicket triggered the collapse and Pakistan lost 5 wickets for 10 runs soon after",neg
"Umar Akmal played a fine cameo, but got out to a poor shot",neg
"Once again Misbah hung around, but the pressure got the better of him and he holed out in the deep",neg
They got off to a poor start when they lost Charles and Samuels early,neg
Both got to their fifties before throwing it away,neg
"Simmons had a reprieve on 43, when Yuvraj dropped a simple catch",neg
Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli fell cheaply but Dhawan was in sublime form,neg
"Yuvraj Singh was an able foil, he wasn't at his best, struggling notably against Narine, but managed to fight along",neg
The pair all but took the match out of the visitor's hands,neg
"For West Indies, Ravi Rampaul and Sunil Narine were exceptional with the ball, but they got no support from the rest of the bowling attack",neg
New Zealand's fielding let them down badly as they dropped Kusal twice and the ground fielding also was not up to the mark,neg
It has started to rain again and the match has been called off,neg
Shehzad was the first to go when he chopped a ball onto the stumps from Tsotsobe,neg
Hafeez and Jamshed did well to stitch a partnership before the latter got out,neg
Soon the rain intervened and they were one hit away from winning.,neg
The latter continued after the departure of his partner and was out just before he could get his maiden T20I fifty,neg
But they were left with too many to get and some good death bowling did not help their cause as well,neg
Only these two teams could have snatched defeat from the hands of victory and South Africa continue to live up to their 'Chokers' tag,neg
His dismissal slowed things down and pressure got to them and eventually they lost by a narrow margin.,neg
Ajmal was once again the pick of the bowlers and was well supported by Rehman but they did not have enough runs on the board.,neg
Dwayne Bravo and Simmons steadied the innings before the skipper was snapped up,neg
Simmons was looking good before he poked at a wide one from Mills,neg
Things never really got going for the New Zealand batsmen,neg
They all got to good starts but were unable to hold on and convert those starts into big scores,neg
The West Indies bowlers were not supported by their fielders,neg
They put down four chances at the start and were sloppy throughout,neg
The others were not effective and went for plenty of runs.New Zealand clinch the T20I series 2-0,neg
They started off well with Ryder going berserk but West Indies came back well to leave the hosts reeling at 5 for 79,neg
"Chasing a mammoth 359 runs for victory, India got off to a tough start as they were tested by some top class fast bowling from Steyn and Morkel, with the former unlucky on numerous occasions as he went past the outside edge on a consistent basis",neg
"Kohli showed some resistance and struck some meaty boundaries, but McLaren worked him over with a peach of a delivery",neg
Dhoni waged a lone battle and he didn't get the support from the other end,neg
India got off to a horrendous start as they lost Dhawan and Kohli for a duck,neg
Rohit and Rahane didn't last long either as they went playing some poor shots,neg
Dhoni and Raina hung around and added 40 runs for the fifth wicket before the latter was sent packing by Philander,neg
Jadeja and Ashwin prolonged the inevitable for a while before succumbing to the pace and bounce of the Proteas bowlers,neg
"Chasing a huge score, Pakistan got off to a poor start losing Shehzad early and rest of the batsmen failed to stitch an useful stand and at one stage they were precariously placed at 121/8, but a fighting stand of 63 for the 9th wicket between Tanvir and Ajmal brought some hope for the home team, but Sri Lanka fought back to snare the remaining 2 wickets.",neg
It looked like the duo were going to pull off an unlikely win with a record 8th wicket stand for Sri Lanka against Pakistan but they couldn't quite hold their nerves in the end.,neg
They started the chase well before both the openers perished run-out,neg
Sangakkara and Chandimal steadied the ship with a 94-run 3rd wicket partnership but Junaid triggered a mini collapse as he knocked over three Sri Lankan batsmen,neg
Misbah-ul-Haq wasn't happy with his side's effort as they let Sri Lanka off the hook from a winning position.,neg
"Sri Lanka were never in the chase, Gul struck twice in his 2nd over, a lot depended on Dilshan and Sangakkara, but the latter was dismissed cheaply",neg
"The rest caved in cheaply, despite a fighting fifty from Dilshan",neg
Sri Lankan bowlers were not effective and they have lot to ponder as their batting and bowling has not clicked in this series so far,neg
"Dilshan and Sanga steadied the innings, before both of them went in succession",neg
The England bowlers couldn't defend 25 runs off the last 2 overs,neg
"But when Clarke took some pace off the ball by introducing the spinners, the visitors started to lose their way",neg
"England recovered for a while in the form of Morgan and Bopara but with the Aussies getting 4 wickets for 21 runs at one stage, England were reduced to 198/8",neg
"With this win, Australia have ensured that England will go home empty-handed",neg
Finch fell in the 6th over just before the opening stand crossed fifty,neg
Maxwell didn't last long either as he hit one in the deep to Bresnan,neg
"England had a daunting task and with a change in the batting-order, the openers found the going tough and perished in quick succession",neg
"But, he could not put the full toss away which sealed the victory for Sri Lanka.",neg
"The Afghans were on top for the first part of the game, but Umar Akmal's knock took the match away from them",neg
"While chasing, their top-order played too defensively and that put the pressure on the other batsmen",neg
"Jadeja and Ashwin pulled things back in the middle overs, but the much haunted death bowling came back to haunt India.",neg
The hosts did not know what hit them as Afridi produced another blast from his armoury to consign Mushfiqur's men to another heart breaking defeat,neg
"Al-Amin Hossain scuppered Sri Lanka's chase, snaring Kusal Perera and Sanga early",neg
Things went from bad to worse when Thirimanne sold Mahela a dummy,neg
But he got very little support from the rest of his mates,neg
"The top-order imploded, each batsman following the other in throwing their wicket away",neg
England got off to a worst possible start,neg
They lost Hales and Wright in successive deliveries,neg
Morgan started postively but he too could not convert his start,neg
Bopara and Bresnan had some late flourish but the match had already slipped out of their hands,neg
Ramdin too gave him good company but the latter perished in pursuit of some quick runs,neg
Sammy and Simmons tried their level best but couldn't quite hold their nerve to get over the line,neg
The bowling was disciplined but they were simply helpless in front of the assault from the Bangladesh batsmen,neg
"Nepal's spinners were undone by the dew, and had no chance of defending the paltry target.",neg
Paul Stirling had to retire hurt after getting a blow on his shoulder,neg
"They lost a clump of wickets towards the end before the match was finished abruptly, thanks to floodlight failure as well as rain",neg
Australia started off poorly as they lost Warner and Watson in the first over,neg
He looked well on course for a hundred before throwing it away,neg
He too got to his fifty but in the end there was too much to do for him.,neg
Bangladesh bowlers did not have much in the bank,neg
They tried their best but could not restrict the two in-form batsmen from playing their shots.,neg
West Indies started the match only after 15 overs,neg
He scored a well compiled 70 and the inexperience showed when he played a poor shot when there was a hundred for the taking,neg
Shaidi and Shenwari then added a 64-run stand for the fourth wicket before Shenwari tried to hurry things up,neg
Hong Kong bowlers were not supported in the field as they put down four catches which did not help their cause.,neg
Amjad was looking good for a hundred but fell just short by two runs,neg
Once he got out there was no support for Khurram and he too perished after a while,neg
"219 was never enough on this track, but the Irish batsmen couldn't handle Mendis and co and lost too many wickets at the start and they could never come back into the game after that",neg
Most of the batsmen were not able to pick Malinga as the Sri Lankan captain mixed his slower deliveries well and finished with the figures of 3/28 from his 4 overs.,neg
"The visitors never really got going with the bat, Mahela was the only one who looked good at the crease but he too perished at the wrong time",neg
"The rest of the batsmen were troubled by Jordan, who was the pick of the bowlers with 3 wickets",neg
"The visitors started off well with McCullum and Williamson going berserk but once Baz fell to Badree, they lost the momentum",neg
"Pollard tightened things in the middle with his variations and once the asking rate went up, the New Zealand batsmen failed to get the big hits away",neg
They lost their last 8 wickets for 44 runs,neg
"A misunderstanding caused Dilshan's exit, and that was followed by a slump",neg
"Mathews fought hard for his 58, but the match was over once he was dismissed.",neg
He fell just when India were in control,neg
Dhoni and Raina tried their best but some good death bowling did not allow them to score as freely as they would have liked,neg
"The Indian skipper kept his side in the game until the final delivery, but was not able to take them past the finishing line.",neg
Hamilton played second fiddle and missed out on his ton by 7 runs,neg
Afghanistan bowlers didn't have any answers to the onslaught,neg
The visitors will have a lot to ponder about for the next game.,neg
The visitors had got off to a fiery start before losing the plot in the middle overs,neg
The story could have been more shameful for the hosts if not for a fighting 64 from Mutumbami,neg
"Eventually, Zimbabwe folded for 159, giving Afghanistan a big 100-run victory",neg
The Pakistan batsmen played some rash shots and perished in the process.,neg
"The former being the aggressor, both men got to their fifties and threw it away",neg
"Once the 100-run stand was broken, Zimbabwe never seemed to go for the victory",neg
"Chigumbura was struggling with an injury to his leg, he was unable to run properly and debutant Jongwe tried his best but he too fell trying to accelerate.",neg
"Once the Tamim-Rahim stand was broken, Bangladesh were never really in the hunt",neg
339 was chasable but the visitors didn't plan their chase properly,neg
Anamul and Kayes played poor shots to put pressure on the rest of the batsmen,neg
Rahim hung around but he couldn't score freely,neg
"Zimbabwe's coach, Steven Mongango, didn't look too plesed with his lads and the hosts have a tough job after this heavy defeat.",neg
Clarke came out to bat in the last over as they lost 9 wickets but he didn't face a ball.,neg
"Zimbabwe's chase never got going, several of their batsmen got starts, but none of them converted it into an innings of note",neg
That ends Zimbabwe's campaign in the tournament,neg
The pacers didn't have a great time and both Irfan and Riaz went for runs.,neg
Guptill and Neesham could not provide the start that their team would have hoped for,neg
"Latham, Brownlie and McCullum all got starts, but none could convert it into a big score",neg
"Apart from Haris Sohail, who picked up three wickets, and Afridi (2 wickets), none of the Pakistani bowlers could trouble the batsmen.",neg
"The visitors got off to a positive start, but Moeen Ali threw it away",neg
"Captain Cook hung around for a while, but the returning Sachithra Senanayake trapped him LBW",neg
"Apart from Senanayake, who got three wickets, none of the Sri Lankan bowlers were impressive.",neg
"But after his dismissal, for a 31-ball 77, West Indies threatened to undermine all his work",neg
"It looked like West Indies would win with three overs to spare, but Wiese brought the hosts back by removing both in quick succession",neg
The visitors lost their way slightly as South Africa picked up 5 wickets in a space of 38 runs,neg
"However, Niall O'Brien held one end up and kept going even as wickets tumbled at the other end",neg
"Wardlaw was the pick of the Scottish bowlers, he was well supported by the rest, but they just didn't have enough runs on the board.",neg
"Mohammed Shami and Axar Patel too bowled well, but their batsmen did not give them enough runs to play with.",neg
"However, he perished in the fourth over after hitting four boundaries",neg
Guptill followed soon after and it seemed at one point that they would miss the solidity of Williamson in the middle order,neg
"The Pakistani bowlers bowled well in patches, but nothing to really trouble the Kiwis.",neg
"Misbah came out with an attacking mindset, but didn't get any support from the other end",neg
None of the other Pakistani batsmen tried to play themselves in as they all fell while looking for runs.,neg
"However, the introduction of spin brought about the downfall of the hosts",neg
Bangladesh were never in the game once they lost Sarkar and Shakib,neg
"At 97/0, Zimbabwe would have had high hopes of bagging a rare series win, but the wickets of Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza and Elton Chigumbura in quick succession hurt them badly",neg
Craig Ervine and Sean Williams were involved in a brisk stand but the former ran himself out,neg
"Soon Sikandar Raza gifted his wicket away and with Regis Chakabva too following him shortly, Zimbabwe looked down and out",neg
"The left-hander also recorded a fifty but once that partnership was broken, New Zealand managed to pick wickets at regular intervals and eventually sealed the match with 14 balls to spare",neg
Zimbabwe never seemed to be in the game after losing early wickets,neg
"When van Wyk was dismissed, New Zealand had a window of opportunity, but the 50-run stand between de Villiers and Amla put the home team in command",neg
"Despite putting up a fine all-round show in the field, the hosts slipped towards a defeat",neg
"However, just when it felt as if, he had steadied the innings, Masakadza was dismissed by the man of the moment, Imad",neg
"Chigumbura then landed a few powerful blows and stitched a key stand with Utseya, but they had too much to do.",neg
"The top-order fell in a heap and despite the best efforts of Sean Williams and Sikandar Raza, it was a mountain that proved too steep",neg
"Chigumbura struck some late blows, but it only lessened the margin of defeat",neg
Miller failed to impress once again and Behardien failed to convert a start,neg
"Soon after he completed his 22nd ODI hundred, Bhuvneshwar removed him and South Africa could never really recover from the blow",neg
England didn't get to the best of starts as they lost Roy and Root inside the first six overs,neg
"Hales looked good in his stay, but the 20-year old Zafar Gohar nipped him out with a lovely flighted delivery",neg
Perera fell 1 run short of what would have been a well-deserved 3rd ODI hundred,neg
"Barring Narine, none of West Indies' bowlers were impressive.",neg
"Afghanistan bowled tight line and lengths, but they did not have enough runs on the board",neg
"However, both of them fell in quick succession",neg
The Sri Lankan bowlers didn't know what hit them,neg
He was unlucky to be dismissed in the nervous nineties,neg
"Rest of the batsmen though, fell to Jongwe and Madziva's incisive bowling",neg
"Changes in the batting order didn't help the Zimbabwean cause as they got off to a disastrous start, losing five wickets in quick succession",neg
Their innings never took off as they were reeling at 34/5 early on,neg
"Masakadza and Moor then got together for a 71-run stand, but Zimbabwe were always chasing the leather",neg
"The Zimbabwean opener got to his fifty, but both Moor and him departed soon after",neg
"Steve Smith and Finch looked in cruise control, until the former was sent back by Jadeja",neg
It was followed by a dramatic collapse,neg
4 wickets went down in quick succession,neg
The late order had too much to do and ended up throwing their wickets in the process.,neg
"New Zealaned looked like they were coasting towards victory at one stage, but a middle-order meltdown cost them dear",neg
"They lost Guptill early, after a horrible misunderstanding with his skipper",neg
"Pakistan kept pegging away, Munro was cleaned up for 56, the inexperienced middle-order faltered and Williamson was left to do too much towards the end.",neg
No one would have thought about this result when the hosts slumped to 99/6 after being asked to bat first,neg
"Henry and McClenaghan made merry towards the end, although the latter was felled by a hostile bouncer",neg
That forced him out of the game and Williamson was left a bowler short,neg
"Hafeez and Babar Azam led the recovery, but both fell to indiscreet shots",neg
"The pressure of the rising rate took its toll on the rest and the tail collapsed badly, despite a brief fight from Sarfraz.",neg
"Pakistan gave a good account of themselves, but will be probably look back at their own batting collapse which cost them plenty of runs",neg
It got worse after skipper Brendon McCullum went for a first ball duck,neg
Pakistan kept fighting and reduced the hosts to 210/5 when rain finally forced a break in play,neg
"Upon resumption, they should have had Ronchi, but he was reprieved by Hafeez and then Corey Anderson got a big share of luck - after umpire Billy Bowden failed to detect a faint edge",neg
We will start losing overs after an hour's delay,neg
Total dominance by Sri Lanka as Canada were never in the game even for a moment,neg
The bowlers backed up the good performance of the batsmen with a clinical display and Canada lost whatever little hope of a fight they had after Davison was sent back first ball by Perera,neg
"In the end, the downpour that started at the end of the 33rd over was enough to ruin the game totally",neg
"Parnell dismissed Perera off a no-ball, a host of gilt-edged run out chances were missed and Morne Morkel compounded the misery by dropping a skier off Mathews",neg
They looked listless in the field in the final hour and one saw the worst of their fielding,neg
The batsmen needed to make it count but put in a listless display,neg
Not even one batsman offered a fight and wickets tumbled at regular intervals as Bangladesh struggled for momentum,neg
Pakistan extend their winning run and Bangladesh's woes continue,neg
"After bundling Pakistan out for 177, Bangladesh might have fancied their chances of victory",neg
"Then, a power failure followed",neg
"After a break of 15 minutes, Pakistan came out and Bangladesh crumbled under the pressure generated by the spinners",neg
"From 69/2, they stumbled to 83/6, with Hafeez and Rehman bowling like a dream",neg
Kapali and Reza strung a partnership but a poor call from umpire Cloete ended the partnership and the Bangladesh tail failed to wag,neg
"Bangladesh made a wrong move right at the start of the innings, sending Islam to open with Tamim",neg
"Shakib tried hard to resurrect the innings with a quick fifty, but did not get support from the other end",neg
In the end the asking rate was too much for the tail and they fell short of the target,neg
Tamim played slowly but the target was too little to defend for the West Indies bowlers,neg
"Zimbabwe started well and put on a solid opening stand, but it was a slow stand which ultimately put the pressure on the ones down the order",neg
"Once the opening wicket fell, Pakistan kept the pressure on and a flurry of wickets in the middle dented Zimbabwe's chase",neg
Australia never really got going after that,neg
Wickets at regular intervals hurt their progress,neg
Hussey waged a lone battle but he fell in search of quick runs and with him fell all the Aussie hopes,neg
"Debutant, Prasanna, picked three quick wickets but it was too late",neg
It is Sri Lanka's biggest loss in terms of deliveries left at home,neg
Pretty poor batting effort it must be said from the visitors as they handed the hosts the victory,neg
Sri Lanka meekly surrendered after the loss of their top 4 batsmen,neg
There was no farewell innings from Jayasuriya as he ended a glittering career on a rather sombre note,neg
"Dilshan, Sangakkara and Mahela failed ro get past single figures",neg
The bowling was poor from the Windies with the exception of the young leggie Bishoo,neg
West Indies never seemed to be in the game despite keeping it tight through some steady bowling backed up by very good fielding but there was not enough fire in the attack to penetrate the strong Pakistan batting,neg
Bishoo was the pick of the bowlers once again but lacked support from the other end,neg
West Indies bowlers gave a good account of themselves but were left with very little to defend,neg
Bangladesh lost their way after a furious start but it was always going to be a tall ask to maintain the tempo throughout the run chase,neg
Bangladesh were never really in the game after that despite fifties from Tamim and Shakib,neg
"Zimbabwe started off well with Coventry playing a few sweet shots, but once he was sucked in by Lee then the innings fell apart",neg
"Cremer played well along with Utseya, but it was only delaying the inevitable",neg
Darren Bravo had given them a solid platform but the Windies failed to capitalise,neg
"However, they were no match to the marauding pair who literally took each and every bowler apart",neg
"Even the normally accurate, Daniel Vettori, was not spared",neg
The match was all but over by the time the openers were dismissed,neg
Guptill and Brendon McCullum never looked like getting out and the Zimbabwe bowlers struggled,neg
"Price, Utseya and Cremer kept it tight but they did not get the wickets",neg
One thought that this would be a match among equals but it was anything but that,neg
Bangladesh have let themselves down completely and it will be a test of their character to come back from this demoralising defeat,neg
"The Zimbabweans tried hard, but their lack of penetration in their bowling meant that they could never have envisioned hopes of a win",neg
Ireland never really recovered after the early strikes by Morkel,neg
In the end a poor WC for the Kenyans as they failed to secure a win all through the tournament,neg
Australia were always facing a herculean task after getting only 176,neg
"Shakib was the highest scorer with 30, but none of the other batsmen could manage anything significant as Bangladesh folded up for 78, the second time that they have been bowled out for under a 100 in this World Cup",neg
Porterfield got an early reprieve when Raja dropped him on 1,neg
It was a disappointing effort in the field from the Dutch and they go home without a single win,neg
"There was a race on who would get to his hundred first, but Haddin fell 12 runs short and he was dismissed at the fag end of the innings",neg
Watson wanted to get to his hundred with a six and threw away his wicket,neg
Ponting's misery continued as he failed to middle the ball yet again,neg
Mohsin Khan will be worried with the way the chase went about,neg
Another poor effort from the Bangladeshi batsmen,neg
The lack of application has been their undoing all these years and it continues to haunt them,neg
The match was decided after just 10 overs of the chase when Bangladesh were reduced to 19/4,neg
"After electing to bat, the Lankans got off to a poor start as the Pakistani seamers bowled a tight line and didn't give anything away",neg
But the introduction of spinners triggered the collapse and they never came back after they lost wickets at regular intervals,neg
"Only Chandimal played steadily, but got out at a crucial time and the rest of the tail couldn't manage to get going",neg
But the Lankans bounced back to take the wickets of Akmal and Ahmed in successive balls and not even a late order blitz from Afridi could take them to victory,neg
"The spinners were ineffective, but the Pakistani middle order could not score as quickly as they would have liked against them",neg
"Umar Akmal would be heartbroken, as it was an innings of true class and maturity after a tentative start",neg
"Zimbabwe would want to forget this game soon, they were completely outplayed in all departments",neg
But the wicket of Chibhabha in the 14th over sparked the collapse and they ended up losing 4 wickets in 4 balls to hand the Kiwis a comfortable win in the end,neg
The bowlers were a huge let down once more,neg
"The English batsmen were ticking the scoreboard well initially, but once Cook got out, the other batsmen followed him to the hut almost like ducklings follow the mother duck",neg
They lost the last 8 wickets for 63 runs,neg
"For Rahane, this match was a horror and he toiled away to 20 off 37 balls",neg
"Considering that this was his home ground, better things were expected from him",neg
"As mentioned earlier, Finn was the pick of the bowlers, but he had practically no support from the others",neg
"The wicket was tough to bat on, India struggled, kept losing wickets and found themselves in deep trouble",neg
That wasn't good enough as the Indian bowlers didn't pick up wickets when needed,neg
South Africa never looked in the chase right from the start,neg
They lost wickets at regular intervals,neg
"There was not much fight from Australia after the Warner-Hussey partnership, and it was all one way traffic from there",neg
So near yet so far for Zimbabwe,neg
Sibanda gave them a perfect start and put on a good stand with the skipper before throwing it away,neg
Taylor continued in the company of Taibu but lost their way towards the end,neg
Chigumbura and Taylor played some strokes towards the end but none of them managed to take them over the line,neg
Trott set it up with a composed knock and Ireland fought well but did not have enough firepower to cross the line,neg
"The Aussies were under pressure, lost wickets regularly and couldn't capitalize",neg
SL bowling was a bit ragged but they hardly had a chance,neg
"Only Shakib and Rahim offered some resistance with the bat, with rest of the batsmen falling to loose shots",neg
"Darren Bravo looked good but failed to get the big hits going and despite his knock of 41, they needed a run rate of over 14",neg
Three quick wickets in the 16th and 17th over made things worse and the West Indies fell short by 16 runs,neg
India looked good to get over 300 at one point but lost the plot completely soon after,neg
India will be disappointed with their effort today,neg
The dropped catches did not help their cause either,neg
The fact that India did not last the entire fifty overs cost them dearly in the end,neg
"Pietersen and Morgan shone briefly with the bat, but it went downhill afterwards as the later order batsmen failed to come into grips with the bowling",neg
Morgan was the only batsman to go past 50 for England as several batsmen got a start but failed to build on it,neg
It has been a rather one sided affair,neg
Pakistan were let down by their batting and the bowlers hardly had any chance of defending a meagre score,neg
"Bangladesh finally showed some resolve to fight, but that was not good enough to stop a rampaging Australia",neg
"Kayes, Nafees and Mahmudullah all scored individual fifties with Kayes unfortunately falling short of his ton by 7 runs",neg
Australia will be pleased by the performance of their batters though they would be a touch disappointed that they failed to bowl Bangladesh out even once,neg
"Bangladesh will feel satisfied by the batting efforts, coming after a pretty poor World Cup, though their reliable spinners took an absolute hammering at the hands of the Aussie batsmen particularly Watson",neg
"When Davison departed to a poor shot, Canada lost steam",neg
Ray Price continued to wreck the top order and picked up 3/16 in eight overs,neg
The openers got off to a slow start and the pressure mounted,neg
Netherlands capitulated from 81/3 to being 120 all out,neg
Canada have thrown away their best chance to stage an upset win over Pakistanis,neg
"Surkari and Hansra kept Canada in the hunt but once Afridi started sending out darters, they fell like nine pins",neg
This was just not Pakistan's day,neg
None of the Pakistani batsmen managed to negotiate the swing and were sent back cheaply,neg
"Umar Akmal and Razzaq struggled to get going in the middle overs, with both struggling to rotate the strike",neg
"Razzaq and Gul delayed the inevitable with a record ninth wicket stand of 66 for Pakistan in World Cups, but it proved to be a bridge too far and Pakistan lost by 110 runs",neg
It looked initially that the Indians wanted to improve the net run rate and win quickly but soon lost the plot as wickets tumbled in quick succession,neg
Admittedly the Indians were looking for a light game and the batsmen seemed to have little respect for the the Dutch bowlers and paid a heavy price for it as the bowlers stuck to the basics,neg
Zimbabwe collapsed from a position of strength and it was that man yet again who started it all for Sri Lanka,neg
Brendan Taylor was in terrific touch and looked good for more but fell at the wrong time and thereafter it was all Sri Lanka,neg
He could have had a hat-trick too but Mahela could not latch on to a low catch after having taken a blinder off the previous delivery,neg
Zimbabwe will be very disappointed after having had a good start and could have shown some more fight,neg
One struggles to understand what the Canadians were doing out there,neg
"Right from the start, they hardly showed any intent in chasing the target down",neg
Bagai and Hansra stroked gritty fifties but they hardly looked like increasing the scoring rate during their stay in the middle,neg
"However, both were laid low by cramps, with Hansra in particular suffering the most",neg
There were significant delays as the physio attended to them,neg
"The wicket was offering appreciable turn, and the Kiwis, who are not great players of the turning ball, succumbed to the great man Murali",neg
New Zealand will be mighty pleased with their effort but they were unlucky that they came up short,neg
Chamara Silva and Samaraweera struggled to score runs and NZ were slowly but surely applying pressure,neg
"Silva continued his poor run, but Samaraweera and Mathews held their nerve till the end",neg
The last wicket stand of 64 between Ramdin and Narine frustrated India but Ramdin was unlucky to miss out on his century,neg
But they ran like madmen and gifted wickets to Pakistan,neg
Sri Lanka made some contentious decisions like sending in Malinga at 8 which did not work,neg
"Sri Lanka need to think hard, for it was a match which they looked set to win, but lost their way",neg
"Chasing 142, they got off to an explosive start, but lost wickets in a heap, with their batsmen falling to loose shots",neg
"On the other hand, the Sri Lankans will be gutted as another 10-15 runs would have made a huge impact to this match, but they were poor in their batting, which has been a concern for them off late and they finish the tour on a disappointing note",neg
Warner departed for a first ball duck but South Africa will be ruing the dropped chance of Watson by Graeme Smith,neg
"Botha consolidated a bit in the middle, but when he fell, things looked bleak for South Africa",neg
"Their bowlers, especially Samuels, strangulated the Bangladesh batsmen during the middle overs",neg
"Rampaul, well, he has always bowled his heart out but somehow misses the target in the final stages of a match",neg
From 71-0 in the 6th over to 149/9 in 20,neg
He came in at a time when SL were struggling at 123/4,neg
Bangladesh would have entertained hopes of choking Australia after they got to 229 but it was not to be,neg
Sri Lanka appeared to be a little confused as to attack first or preserve wickets and the fall of wickets at regular intervals did not help their cause either,neg
"Sammy started off with Roach and Benn, the pace and spin combination did not allow the batsmen to settle down, they kept losing wickets in quick intervals and after ten Doeschate failed to score, it was a tough ask from the middle and the lower order batsmen",neg
"Cheema got going immediately, but he was cleaned up by Otieno",neg
A slight stutter occurred in the middle when Gunasekera and Surkari departed cheaply,neg
"Off James Ngoche's first ball, he mistimed a shot to mid on and Waters spilled a sitter",neg
Kenya will be very disappointed with their effort,neg
Ireland have faltered after getting a good start,neg
Ed Joyce and Wilson had kept them in the hunt for a long time with well made fifties but West Indies were all over the Irish batsmen once these two fell,neg
India will have no one to blame except themselves,neg
They had the match in the bag but lost their heads in the end overs and that has cost them dearly,neg
"The wickets of Pollard and Sarwan were key, and once they went, it was a touch too much to ask from the West Indian tail",neg
Wickets tumbled at the end as South Africa made a match of it,neg
The Pakistani batting failed to get going,neg
"The balance of the game shifted from one side to the other, at the halfway stage the Indians were sitting comfortably at the top, but sensational batting from Strauss took the game totally away from them",neg
"Wyk and Steyn strung together a gritty 33 run stand, but Bresnan sent Wyk back and it looked like the game would go down the wire",neg
"Bangladesh lost their way for a while, with Tamim, Siddique and Roqibul falling in quick succession",neg
"Just when the English shoulders dropped, Bangladesh gifted them a wicket - the wicket of the well set Kayes to a needless run out",neg
"Sensing a defeat looming large, a major part of the crowd started to leave",neg
Pressure shifted to England once again and they had no answers,neg
Their players were spirited right until the last runs were scored and showed a very good attitude on the field,neu
They were not intimidated by some of the big names in the Pakistan side and walk off with heads held high.,neu
Easy chase in the end for New Zealand,neu
"He got some useful support from Nicol, Brendon and Williamson on the way",neu
They will look to do better in the 2nd match at Hamilton.,neu
A couple of partnerships was all it needed for South Africa to chase this target and they got exactly that,neu
One has to say that the better team won today,neu
South Africa have been better in all disciplines in this series and they have shown it today,neu
Nothing went right for the Kiwis today at Auckland,neu
Another comprehensive win for Ireland,neu
Kenya were outclassed in all the departments today and they will be looking to put up a much improved performance in the next match tomorrow.,neu
Easy win for Ireland in the end and they take an unassailable 2-0 lead in this 3-match series,neu
On the other hand Kenyans are still searching for their first win.,neu
Ireland complete a whitewash and rout Kenya 3-0 in this 3-match T20I series,neu
"Defending a low total, they struck at regular intervals to put pressure on Kenya",neu
Once again Dockrell was the pick of the bowlers,neu
"Overall, Ireland will be satisfied by their performance in this tour.",neu
A real rollercoaster of a ride,neu
Pakistan have outclassed their opponents today,neu
Mahela who has impressed as a captain so far looked absolutely clueless today,neu
Sri Lanka have had a dismal Asia Cup so far and now they are more or less out of the tournament,neu
Tamim gave them the perfect start and was well supported by Jahurul,neu
The win also makes it Ireland's 7th win in a row,neu
Paul Stirling and Porterfield made light work of the chase after their bowlers' good work,neu
Hugs and fist pumps all around from the Afghanistan team,neu
This was a thorough team effort,neu
"Stirling was very impressive, but it must be said that Namibia's bowling was pedestrian",neu
A comprehensive win for the Aussies in the end,neu
"Chasing 205 was bit tricky on this slow and low pitch, But the Australian bowlers bowled a tight line and made life tougher for WI",neu
This is West Indies' first win against Australia since the champions trophy game in India in 2006,neu
A moment to remember indeed,neu
It has been an absolute team effort,neu
So Australia have finally shown some dominance on this tour,neu
"They were a bit too loose in the ODI series, but thanks to Watson and Hussey, their batting has come into their own",neu
Overall a bullying win for Australia,neu
"In the end, the West Indies held their nerve as they clinched the match by 14 runs to level the series 1-1",neu
"They haven't had much luck with the Duckworth and Lewis in the past, but today it went their way.",neu
A clinical performance from England today has helped them rout WI by a comfortable margin,neu
England go one up in this 3-match series.,neu
"They ran hard, converted singles into doubles and kept finding the boundary regularly",neu
Some credit obviously has to be given to Sri Lanka for their bowling and sharpness in the field.,neu
The first leg of the tour ends at 1-1,neu
Some positives for both teams though the batting will be a cause of concern for either team's management,neu
"With this win, Pakistan have now won 9 of their past 11 ODIs against Sri Lanka",neu
"Pakistan, for the second time in the series, were coasting along in the middle overs",neu
"Like in the 2nd ODI, it was the skipper Misbah and Azhar Ali who were anchoring the chase",neu
Misbah lost the plot before the toss only when he left out Ajmal and got in Sami in his place,neu
This pitch was conducive for spin bowling and they were one spinner short,neu
Sami's figures are the most expensive by a Pakistani in Sri Lanka.,neu
He cleverly mixed his pace and the South African batsmen found the going tough,neu
Cremer then flummoxed the Proteas with his leg breaks and googly,neu
"Taylor led the way with a captain's knock, he was all class today, wonder why he is never considered for a contract in any T20 franchises across the world? That is for later though, Masakadza was scratchy but did well to stay and aid his skipper",neu
Good practise ahead of the T20 WC for them,neu
One hopes that the rain stays away and that we can get some cricket,neu
"They lost both set batsmen quickly and only Clarke showed some character in the middle, with the other batsmen failing to make any valuable contribution",neu
Yet another convincing victory for the hosts,neu
210 was always going to be a difficult target on a pitch that got slower,neu
This has been a comprehensive win for them,neu
"Badree, Samuels and Bravo did their bit too",neu
It has been an efficient performance from the West Indies,neu
"After setting a huge total, the pressure was always on the Kiwis",neu
"New Zealand always needed someone to play right through the match and strike at a good rate, however, they were always left wanting",neu
West Indies now enjoy a 2-0 lead in this five match series.,neu
Not a lot of people would have placed their money on a 88 run victory for New Zealand at the start of the game,neu
Tino Best and Sunil Narine were the absolute stars in the bowling line-up,neu
Wild celebrations in the Windies camp and they thoroughly deserve it,neu
"On the other hand, Kiwis have a lot of thinking to do as they were hampered by the injuries and their in-experienced middle order was exposed against a strong WI attack",neu
"That ends this tie, and Scotland were the better side in all departments",neu
The Scots had to chase a low total and they decided to play aggressively in order to do so,neu
"After putting on a small total on board, the Scots needed to do bowl really well to win the game",neu
"The star of today's game was Kevin O'Brien, who had earlier chipped in with a wonderful cameo of 32 to accelerate the run-rate",neu
Netherlands should have won it easily after being well set at one stage,neu
They played a little slowly as the innings neared its death,neu
It was down to 13 runs required off the last over,neu
Mashrafe was the man,neu
England have sealed a much-needed win,neu
"Despite some good bowling from Peterson and Parnell, the target of 212 was never going to be daunting.",neu
"South Africa were always playing the second fiddle after losing the toss, they pottered around to 220",neu
Kallis and Duminy played very well while the England bowlers struggled,neu
Chasing on this pitch under the lights was always going to be difficult,neu
The three match series is drawn 1-1 after the second match was washed out due to rain,neu
Malinga got some batting practice towards the end,neu
That seals India's 400th ODI victory and it gives them an unassailable 3-1 series lead,neu
Eventually India cruised through to 6 wicket victory.,neu
Haq and Davey picked up three wickets and none of the Bangladesh batsmen got going,neu
"This is a deserved victory for Scotland and for Bangladesh, they have come crashing down to earth with a bang after clean-sweeping Ireland.",neu
Bangladesh will feel that they have finally redeemed themselves,neu
They were always on top of their opponents in the chase,neu
"At the end of the day, there was a clear difference in the quality of the two sides and that resulted in Bangladesh running away with the game.",neu
Netherlands level the series 1-1,neu
Bangladesh will look back at their batting collapse,neu
22 at less than run a ball has cost India but enough credit should be given to the Kiwi bowlers,neu
The cutters worked very well as the ball got older and the big hits just failed to come off,neu
The win coming from behind will be a huge boost for the tourists,neu
They clinch the series too with that.,neu
Professional performance from Australia,neu
The reply from AFG was entertaining,neu
"Oh boy, Australia had to fight every inch of their way to get to this target",neu
"Saeed Ajmal, in particular, confounded the Australians with his doosra",neu
"They were lucky to lose the toss, their spinners enjoyed bowling on a slow and low track",neu
"Chasing 249, Hafeez and Jamshed got them off to a breezy start",neu
Good chase from Australia,neu
Australia didn't even compete,neu
The lesser said about Australia the better,neu
This is probably where experience counts,neu
Gul bowled a fantastic over while Cummins showed his inexperience and sprayed it all over the place,neu
"Though the scorecard for the series will say 2-1, this win is likely to keep them in really high spirits",neu
"In one word, Australia's performance today can be termed as 'Dominating'.",neu
This match will be remembered for the performance of both Ajantha and Jeevan Mendis,neu
The scorecard says won by 23 runs but there were a few nervous moments for India,neu
The catching was the difference in the end,neu
"Afghanistan dropped 4 catches, while India took everything that came their way",neu
This is also the second instance where a team has won by 10 wickets in all editions of this tournament.,neu
Bangladesh have now lost nine consecutive T20Is in all editions of this tournament,neu
South Africa have a lot of soul-searching to do,neu
Saeed Ajmal was the exception,neu
Pakistan will take a lot of confidence from this hard fought win.,neu
Eoin Morgan will be a disappointed man,neu
The Pakistani camp is absolutely thrilled to bits,neu
 Undoubtedly the star of the game was Luke Wright,neu
"None of the NZ bowlers did anything extraordinary, though their fielding was outstanding.",neu
It was the Shane Watson show once again today,neu
South Africa have much to think,neu
"Their ground fielding has been excellent in parts, but their catching has been awful",neu
They still have an outside chance to make the semis,neu
For that they will want India to win against Pakistan.,neu
The Pakistani spinners proved to be a handful on this pitch,neu
Raza Hasan and Saeed Ajmal were too good for the Australian top order,neu
It will be Sri Lanka versus West Indies on 7th.,neu
They would have backed themselves to put up a fight with that total,neu
The dew played a factor too but NZ were in the game until it went into the last 10 overs,neu
Nothing much to say about the West Indies,neu
A chase anchored by Marlon Samuels,neu
He was well supported by Kieron Powell as the visitors cruised along,neu
The series now stands at 2-1 in favour of the hosts with two still to play.,neu
They have blown away a 2-0 lead and will now head to tommorrow's final match with all to play for,neu
Sammy was the star of the show today,neu
Bangladesh should not be satisfied with this performance,neu
"When you lose just 1 wicket, you should expect to score more than just 179 on a flat track",neu
"For West Indies, it was Gayle's off spin which made the difference",neu
On a batting paradise a score well in excess of 180 runs was required,neu
"In retrospect, England will feel that they were about 20 runs short and bowled one wide too many.",neu
England have squared the series 1-1,neu
"Apart from that, there was nothing much to separate between the teams",neu
Kevin Pietersen was the only batsman who looked in any sort of comfort but after his dismissal the Indian spinners got stuck in and never let the pressure off.,neu
Rohit Sharma surprised one and all by responding to his skipper's call,neu
"England will rue the missed chance when Raina was caught at slip, but Finn had knocked off the bails and it was called a dead ball",neu
Raina was on 42 then and it could have been the turning point,neu
But Dernbach and Bresnan could do little,neu
India fought hard with the ball,neu
Australia go to Adelaide with a 1-0 lead.,neu
Bailey and Marsh got a few boundaries and took Australia to the last over,neu
"Almost a one man show, that",neu
New Zealand's innings was all about Guptill,neu
What a chase this has been,neu
Dhoni did it with the lower order when they batted,neu
Bhuvaneshwar Kumar led the way with the ball,neu
168 wasn't a great score on this track but the fielders made it look like a score close to 200,neu
The Man of the Match award went to Pujara but a lot of credit should go to Ojha as well,neu
India's pacers outshone their England counterparts as well,neu
Spare a thought for Cook as well,neu
Mahela will look back at his decision to bowl first too,neu
AB de Villers unfurled his Vil-Scoop and looked set to take the game away from Pakistan,neu
Umar Gul came into the attack and he changed the complexion of the game,neu
"The match was set up by the bowlers though, and Pakistan will travel to the Wanderers on an even kneel",neu
The Durban jinx continues for the hosts,neu
"For Australia, it was Faulkner who was the pick of the bowlers",neu
"Well with a mammoth score of over 200, the scoreboard pressure will always be telling on the side that is chasing",neu
"Chasing a below par total of 212, they got off to a cautious start, but lost Sarwan early",neu
So Sri Lanka hold onto their No.1 ranking in T20Is for this year,neu
Spinners did the job for the visitors to reduce Zimbabwe to 9 wickets,neu
Kudos to West Indies,neu
"Later, thanks to Charles, their innings went through smoothly before a few brain fades made the match interesting",neu
India will not exactly be displeased with this act,neu
"However, with their departures, West Indies fell behind but they ensured Sri Lanka did not concede the bonus point",neu
So West Indies have managed to square the series here with 3 games to go,neu
This looks like a bat first pitch,neu
It had everything in it,neu
West Indies would have backed themselves to chase down 230 on a decent batting strip,neu
It was down to 15 runs needed off the last over,neu
Pakistan needed 121 in 14 overs,neu
"With 8 wickets in hand, one would back the batting side",neu
Hafeez and Misbah scored fifties to keep the run rate in check,neu
"Thisara had other ideas as he smashed 35 runs from one Peterson over, but the visitors held their nerve to close out the game.",neu
Zimbabwe were then just trying to play out the 50 overs,neu
They managed to do that,neu
The result was never in doubt once they bowled Zimbabwe out for 144,neu
Taylor was dismissed by Ajmal and Waller was castled by Junaid,neu
Mitch Johnson was at his best today and consistently bowled at over 93 MPH to trouble the English batsmen,neu
The stage was set for Virat Kohli,neu
The match was poised evenly when the rain Gods interrupted,neu
The arrival of ABD saw South Africa shift gears,neu
They huffed and puffed before getting through,neu
The last sentence sums up the night India just had,neu
All South African seamers were amongst the wickets and India have to sort the short ball issue pretty soon as they were bounced out consistently,neu
It was just a matter of time till the end was near,neu
"Gul took 3 wickets, Hafeez capped a fine day with two while there were 2 each for Ajmal and Junaid",neu
"Once again they lost Sharjeel early, but it was Hafeez all the way like it has been in this series so far",neu
"Mathews struggled to get the ball of the square, but it was the Chandimal and Mendis partnership of 40 runs that saw them through",neu
"At 120/5, Australia were down and out and hopes of England's first win on the tour were very high",neu
Glenn Maxwell and Brad Haddin batted sensibly to add 80 runs for the 6th wicket after Shaun Marsh's fine fifty,neu
Faulkner was very calm at the start,neu
Stokes offered some very generous length balls to help Faulkner muscle them,neu
"130 was never going to be enough on this wicket, especially against this Australian side",neu
A very disciplined effort from Australia meant that the batsmen had to work really hard for their runs,neu
They rotated the strike and concentrated on not giving their wickets away to the spin duo,neu
Bangladesh were in the game until the last delivery,neu
Ajmal was as-usual wily with his variations and none of the Afghan batsmen could read the doosra,neu
"Facing a Himalayan task, Pakistan needed a sturdy start",neu
"They never looked like losing this game, at least until the final few overs",neu
The main concern was the way they handled the spinners,neu
Never quite sure who's going to win the match until the final ball,neu
"The target was hardly challenging, especially with the dew around",neu
"Munir Dar though had different ideas, he kept the score-board ticking with cheeky ones, twos and the occassional boundaries",neu
Maxwell and Finch seemed to be playing on a different pitch as they carved the bowling to all parts of the ground,neu
Maxwell in particular seemed to be in a hurry as he got his fifty off just 18 balls,neu
Dhoni promoted himself up the order and spent some time out in the middle,neu
The UAE innings was based on two partnerships,neu
First between Amjad and Faris who added 70 runs for the opening wicket and then between Amjad and Khurram who stitched a 86-run stand for the fourth wicket,neu
"Though the rain made the run chase interesting for a while, India won the game easily in the end",neu
"There was a long rain break and once play resumed, Bangladesh's spinners got some purchase and troubled the Indian batsmen for a short while",neu
What a thriller! We did not know the winner until the last ball of the game,neu
The game swung like a pendulum,neu
"However, the Sri Lankan spinners rallied to snatch the initiative from the visitors",neu
"Zimbabwe had no chance in chasing the target down, but barring Hamiltom Masakadza (70), none of the other batsmen showed any aptitude",neu
Zimbabwe put Australia under pressure right from the word go,neu
Spin was introduced as early as the second over and the Australian batsmen were never comfortable at the crease,neu
Three wickets for JP Duminy and the rest of the bowlers chipped in with their bit as well,neu
South Africa will now face Australia in the much anticipated final on Saturday.,neu
"Raza Hasan was the pick of the bowlers, picking up 2 wickets in his 4-over spell, while skipper Afridi too got himself into the wickets column",neu
"When West Indies were reduced to 121/5, it looked like India were quickly going to wrap things up, but Samuels and Russell hit some lusty blows to keep the game wide open",neu
"The series is now 1-1, with three games to go",neu
It's 3-2 currently in the series with two matches to go,neu
"Chasing 232, the intent was pretty clear from Smith and Gayle",neu
"Binny finished with three wickets, while Mohit Sharma bagged two",neu
"However, Graeme Cremer gave decent support to Williams, who was fighting hard",neu
"Mitchell McClenaghan was the pick of the bowlers with three wickets, while Ish Sodhi bagged two.",neu
"If George Worker essayed an enterprising knock, then the bowlers picked up wickets at regular intervals to restrict the hosts to a meagre total",neu
"James Neesham, Ish Sodhi and Nathan McCullum were also among the wickets",neu
Only Craig Ervine played a handy knock,neu
Luke Ronchi and Colin Munro notched up quick-fire cameos in the end overs.,neu
"Doug Bracewell, Mitchell McClenaghan, Adam Milne and George Worker picked up a wicket apiece, but they needed more from their bowlers.",neu
The players shake hands with each other and the Australian players are all smiles as they walk back,neu
"There were a few rain breaks and it looked as if it was going to favour the team batting second, but Australia captured key moments to seal the contest",neu
"Nathan Coulter-Nile finished with three wickets, while Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins bagged two apiece.",neu
Imad Wasim starred for the visitors by picking up four wickets in his quota of four overs,neu
"On a track, where it was stopping on the batsmen, Zimbabwe struggled to counter the unremitting control of Imad",neu
Hamilton Masakadza showed self-belief at top of the order,neu
"Once again, Pakistan's bowling turned out to the difference between the two teams",neu
"However, de Villiers was growing strong at one end and at one stage it appeared as if he would single-handedly take the Proteas home",neu
"Bhuvi bagged three wickets, while Harbhajan picked up two",neu
"Mohit, Axar and Mishra bagged a wicket each.",neu
Morgan soon followed Hales as he missed a straighter one from Malik,neu
Sunil Narine though came on and knocked over the latter first ball with a seam-up ball that swung back in and totally deceived the batsman,neu
"By the time he got out, Sri Lanka were well ahead and Dinesh Chandimal and Thirmanne completed the formalities",neu
Cameo from Williams in the middle kept the scoreboard moving,neu
Amir Hamza was the pick of the bowlers as he ended with figures of 3 for 47,neu
Another 15-20 runs would have made the match more interesting.,neu
Both fell but the task had been completed by then,neu
Nicholls helped himself to useful runs as the hosts' chased down the target - with 174 balls to spare.,neu
"Dilshan was happy to play second fiddle, but took over after his partner fell",neu
"With this win, Zimbabwe now trail the series 1-2",neu
"In the end, Zimbabwe's total proved to be too much for Afghanistan.",neu
They were helped along by some ordinary bowling by Ashwin,neu
"Bumrah came in and provided the visitors with some relief, Warner fell for 17",neu
New Zealand go 1-0 up in the 3-match series,neu
New Zealand take the 3-match series 2-0,neu
291 wasn't going to be an easy chase,neu
An easy win for Mortaza's men in the end,neu
"The umpires had a chat about the rain, as it got heavier they have called for the covers",neu
But spare a thought for Sri Lanka,neu
Sri Lanka will be very confident going into the next game and Canada have not displayed any reason for the ICC to change their stance on minnows in the next WC,neu
It has been a great pity for the fans who were expecting a cracker of a match,neu
Both teams will share points,neu
South Africa will reflect upon the chances that they failed to convert,neu
They will want to finish the home summer on a high and the Highvelds await another cracker of a contest between these two teams on Sunday,neu
Dilshan and Sangakkara share a warm hug,neu
This win must boost the morale of the Lankans as well as that of the underfire Dilshan and Geoff Marsh,neu
They have had a torrid time in the ODIs and have a win to show for their efforts,neu
Bangladesh just cannot defeat Pakistan,neu
It seemed that Bangladesh would coast along to the target,neu
"The former played out too many dot balls and the pressure, eventually got to the Bangladesh batsman",neu
"For the West Indies, Rampaul and Samuels bowled their hearts out picking up 2 wickets in the process",neu
"A target of 221 could have been a tricky one, given the nagging length that the Bangladeshi spinners bowl",neu
"Once they bowlers started wearing out, they jumped on the accelerator",neu
Hyatt got out for a well made 39,neu
"The man to replace him, Samuels just gave an example of his hunger for runs",neu
He negotiated the good deliveries and mauled the bad ones,neu
Bangladesh could not have timed this better,neu
It has started to drizzle in Chittagong and they will be relieved,neu
"On a sluggish Chittagong track, Bangladesh have huffed and puffed their way to the target",neu
Stay tuned for the presentation,neu
A thumping victory for Swann in his first match as captain,neu
Sammy will have to motivate his boys to come out of this defeat quickly,neu
"Bopara, the Man of the Match, showed that he could be very useful with the ball in helpful conditions",neu
The dew played a factor too with the WI spinners struggling to grip the ball in the latter part of the game,neu
Never has the difference in fielding quality been more apparent,neu
Zimbabwe were all over the field and dropped quite a few catches,neu
"Pakistan, on the other hand, caught everything that came their way and managed to convert a couple of half-chances too",neu
"The bowlers set the match up beautifully yet again with Bollinger leading the way, the batsmen did not need to do anything fancy, Watson was a bit cautious for his 43",neu
The Lankan strategy of piling up spinners is not working at the moment,neu
Malinga provided the early wicket when he got rid of the danger man Watson,neu
SL have made it 2-1 now and showed that they were not going to be rolled over,neu
Clarke was there till the end to take Australia home,neu
Zimbabwe have cantered home by seven wickets here,neu
Shafiul and Rubel maintained the pressure at the start when they snapped Taylor cheaply,neu
"However, Sibanda and Masakadza steadied the ship before Masakadza departed",neu
Badri and Yusuf looked out of place and their places will come under scrutiny after their failures,neu
The West Indies didn't do anything spectacular and just did the basics right,neu
Any victory should please the fan of the home side for it has been a rare sight seeing their side win these days,neu
The Windies would need to pull up their socks ahead of the next match on Monday,neu
India will be looking to take this momentum into their next game while Bangladesh will have to pull up their socks very soon to bring some cheer to their passionate fans,neu
Johnson picked up a few quick wickets and from then on it was always going to be an uphill task and it proved to be in the end,neu
It's been a comprehensive win to say the least,neu
Both were in an aggressive mood looking to make the most of any small discretions in line and length by the bowlers,neu
NZ bowlers were defending a very modest total and it was vital that they maintained pressure by taking early wickets,neu
"Kenya will have a lot to think about in the upcoming games, while Sri Lanka have given their fans a lot to cheer about after the disappointing loss to Pakistan",neu
Comprehensive is the only word that comes to mind when one describes NZ's batting performance,neu
Collins Obuya will probably look back at this innings quite fondly despite missing the ton and the Kenyans do have some positives to take out from this game,neu
Shambolic is what one can describe Bangladesh's exit from the 2011 World Cup,neu
One struggled to figure out the mindset of the Bangladeshi batsmen when they walked out to bat,neu
A strange little match which never rose above the levels of mediocrity finally ends,neu
"Sri Lanka huffed and puffed their way to 236, not showing any intent even during the slog overs",neu
The visitors have all the work to do ahead of the next 3 matches with the hosts sitting pretty at 2-0,neu
"The bowlers did well to make a match in the end, but you cannot expect them to win matches from near impossible situations",neu
It was the Malinga and Perera show,neu
124 was never going to be a problem for New Zealand,neu
Certainly not with an opener named Brendon McCullum,neu
Brendan Taylor must be wondering what more he should do to inspire his men,neu
This might be the headline in most of the news forums tomorrow morning,neu
It was not that stiff a target for an Indian batting lineup brought up on such tracks,neu
"They picked the singles and doubles regularly and once the target looked to be in reach, launched an attack which stunned the Englishmen",neu
Warner departed for a first ball duck but South Africa will be ruing the dropped chance of Watson by Graeme Smith,neu
"Great team effort in the end, hand shakes all around as the Sri Lankans make their way out",neu
England can do no wrong here,neu
"After a short rain delay, the target was reduced to 218 in 43 overs",neu
Stokes and Bopara played steadily,neu
Rain meant India were set a revised target of 183 and they seemed to be in a hurry after the resumption,neu
WI were clinical in the chase,neu
Sangakkara fought hard for his 75 as SL managed to post 174,neu
The best partnership of the innings was 40 between Zuiderent and Barresi,neu
"However, the South African spinners led by Tahir and Peterson ran through the lower middle order",neu
India have made heavy weather of a low target and it was left to their last two specialist batsmen to get them home,neu
This match will once again throw up the debate about the role of the associate members in the World Cup,neu
"From the Ireland fairy-tale against England to the Canadian Yawn against New Zealand, the associate members have had extreme results",neu
"The Dutch, however, got their own back, when they made Bangladesh work hard for the last 10 runs",neu
Parnell and Theron have put on a partnership of 64 runs in 27 deliveries,neu
It was just one of those days for White and his boys,neu
"But as they say, when the going gets tough, the tough get going and Parnell & Theron proved just that",neu
He came in at a time when SL were struggling at 123/4,neu
"However, the turning point of the match occurred when Hansra came to the crease",neu
Wilson will consider himself very unlucky after being dismissed under controversial circumstances and the UDRS debate will rage on,neu
Both teams had their chances of closing the game out but the momentum kept shifting repeatedly and SA held their nerves,neu
Phew! Let me catch my breath,neu
Bishoo was the star as he snapped up four wickets,neu
This has been a nerve-wracking encounter to say the least,neu
But Swann and Shahzad held their nerves and this was a fitting end to an evenly contested game,neu
"Ladies and Gentlemen, the word choke has a new meaning in all dictionaries",neu
The new meaning reads South Africa,neu
Only they could conspire to lose from a winning situation,neu
"It looked great at 124/3, but they lost 4 wickets for just just three runs",neu
He had Smith all at sea against his ripping off-breaks,neu
"Then, a sea-saw battle started",neu
"In came captain Shakib Al Hasan, with a world of pressure on his shoulders",neu
"Well, they must be cursing themselves now",neu
Don't ever leave the stadium when England is playing! Bangladesh found an unexpected hero with the bat in the form of Shafiul Islam,neu
"Wides, half volleys and fumbles followed as the remaining crowd got behind their heroes",neu
New Zealand would be thinking about their last five overs with the ball and the middle-order collapse with the bat,"neu
"

A comprhensive win for Pakistan but they have been made to work for the victory,pos
A commendable show by Afghanistan in their first outing,pos
Martin Guptill has been in prime form this season and he has helped NZ draw first blood,pos
They were in a bit of bother when they lost their first 3 wickets but de Villiers and JP Duminy put on a steady stand and built a solid platform,pos
Runs were coming mainly in singles and doubles but the asking rate was never allowed to climb beyond comfort,pos
"Duminy fell but du Plessis walked in and played his shots, helping himself to a fifty in company of his skipper (who reached a century himself)",pos
"In the end, it turned out to be a comfortable victory for the visitors.",pos
This total was below-par on a flat track and Amla ensured that South Africa suffered no serious hiccups,pos
His 92 oozed with class and he was helped by some poor fielding from the Kiwis,pos
Amla was at his supreme best as he stroked his 18th fifty,pos
Parnell and Albie Morkel also chipped in with some good knocks,pos
They have managed to chase down the target very easily,pos
"Getting 108 was always easy, but they lost quick wickets initially, but Joyce and Kevin O'Brien held the innings together with a solid stand to ensure there were no further hiccups in the chase",pos
"They had rested Ed Joyce today and everyone thought chasing 132 would be difficult, but Stirling batted brilliantly to stay unbeaten till the end and also notched up his highest T20I score",pos
A thrilling end to the series,pos
But C Obuya and Mishra fought pretty well and revived them a bit with a 50 run stand for the 3rd wicket,pos
What an amazing match this turned out to be,pos
Both sides were in it until the last few overs when Pakistan suddenly took the game away from the hosts,pos
Tamim set up the run chase perfectly for Bangladesh with a half century,pos
At the end it was the Gulldozer who came out on top and really just bowled his side to victory courtesy those terrific reverse swinging yorkers.,pos
Umar Akmal and Misbah steadied the ship after those quick losses and really took their side through till the end,pos
Akmal perished in the process of trying to secure the bonus point but Hammad Azam came in and struck the 5th ball that he faced to the fence to secure that extra point,pos
A superb chase aided by some dreadful bowling has sealed a famous win,pos
"The dew played its part, but full credit to the way the Bangladeshi batsmen applied themselves",pos

Very good cricket from Pakistan,pos

All the batsmen contributed in the chase which is a very good sign ahead of the series,pos
A spectacular victory for Bangladesh,pos
They have trumped their fancied opponents by a massive 160 run margin,pos

This is also Bangladesh's biggest ever win in terms of runs.,pos
They lost a few wickets in a hurry towards the end but the presence of Samuels was vital,pos
"Bangladesh bowled their hearts out, especially the spinners who made the ball talk despite all the dew",pos
Bangladesh's jinx at Mirpur continues,pos
He followed his unbeaten 60 with an incisive burst that saw him grab 3 top order wickets,pos

"In the end, Nasir Hossain held firm and scored the winning runs to seal a 3-2 victory.",pos
"Mahmudullah went past a half century and Tamim Iqbal almost made a century, but they missed out on a lot of scoring chances in the middle overs",pos
He conceded only 18 runs in his 4 overs in the middle and changed the game their way,pos
Yuvraj Singh dazzled with an all-round performance and should surely be the Man of the Match,pos
The chase was very professional from England,pos
The openers gave them a great start,pos
Yuvraj Singh pulled things back with a miserly spell where he picked up 3 wickets as well,pos
A lot depended on Morgan who came in late to take England across and he did it in style.,pos
"Except Kohli, all the recognised batsmen got going and looked like playing a big knock while they were in the middle",pos
"For England, it was off-spinner James Tredwell who was a revelation as he brought up his best ODI figures",pos
"Dernbach was costly, but picked up the big wicket of Dhoni.",pos
Ravindra Jadeja had a day to remember,pos
"He contributed with bat, ball and on the field to help India to a big win",pos
Bhuvaneshwar Kumar was the star early on,pos
His 10 over spell right at the top ensured that England were always on the backfoot,pos

This win will restore some pride for England,pos
Ian Bell was clinical in the chase,pos
The game was heading for a tight finish going into the last 10 overs but the dominant stand between Eoin Morgan and Ian Bell sealed it for England,pos
They will be elated to go home on a winning note.,pos
A straightforward win for the hosts despite missing many of their batting stars,pos
A superb century from Hughes and outstanding batting efforts from Bailey and Hussey set them up for a huge score on the board,pos
"The bowlers then stood up, Tharanga and Mahela were dismissed cheaply, Dilshan and Chandimal steadied the ship before the calamitous run-out of Dilshan started the slide",pos
Doherty and Maxwell stifled the scoring rate as they picked up wickets at regular intervals,pos
"However, Mathews steadied the ship and Thisara Perera supported him well",pos
Thisara finished off the game with a couple of sixes to help Sri Lanka go 1-0 up in the two match series.,pos
A nail-biting game this,pos
The revised target seemed to favour Australia but Sri Lanka's bowlers held their nerves and clinched the win,pos
An utterly dominant show from the hosts,pos
"After the loss of an early wicket, du Plessis, the first time skipper played a matured knock",pos
"Debutant, Quinton de Kock, got into his stride as well and it should give him some confidence that he stayed on till the end.",pos
Nicol and Brendon McCullum played their part and gave good support to Guptill as he flayed the South African attack,pos
He hit as many as six 6s and was particularly harsh on the spinners - Peterson and Phangiso,pos
"In the end, it was a well deserved victory for New Zealand.",pos
The Proteas fielded like tigers and their catching was of the highest standard,pos
Mclaren and Phangiso were the pick of the bowlers with 3 wickets each,pos
With that South Africa win the 3 match T20I series 2-1.,pos
Phew,pos
BJ Watling and Brendon McCullum got going thanks to a gritty partnership,pos
The 47 run stand for the 9th wicket between Kyle Mills and James Franklin got NZ closer to the target,pos
"In the end, Mitchell McClenaghan managed to survive and Franklin scored the winning runs as they won the first ODI at Paarl by one wicket.",pos
New Zealand have fought admirably,pos
Credit to them for keeping up the pressure and bowling and fielding brilliantly,pos
They have proven yet again that catches and sharp fielding can help win you a match,pos
"They were 167/1 at one stage, cruising along with Smith and Colin Ingram at the crease",pos
"Mills was the pick of the NZ bowlers with 2/28 in 9 overs, while Nathan McCullum and Guptill impressed in the field",pos
The visitors win the series 2-0 with one ODI to go.,pos
It was a see-saw battle all the way today,pos
261 wasn't an easy target but South Africa got a very good start,pos
"However, a dramatic finish courtesy Ryan McLaren ensured that South Africa wouldn't 'choke' again.",pos
Yet another India vs Pakistan thriller,pos
What a roller-coaster ride in just a span of 20 overs,pos
134 wasn't too big a target but Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowled a stunning spell on debut to send panic waves through the Pakistan camp,pos
"Pakistan were 12/3 at one stage, but Pakistan's skipper Hafeez and the experienced Shoaib Malik calmed them down with some steady batting, before going on the attack towards the end",pos
"Things turned again towards the end as India got a couple of quick wickets, but Malik stayed calm and took them through.",pos
A cracking game of cricket and India deservedly level the series 1-1,pos
Pakistan take a 1-0 lead in the series,pos
Deservingly too,pos
India did well to fight back from some tight situations,pos
There was a flicker of hope for India when Ishant Sharma sent back Misbah-ul-Haq but Shoaib Malik steadied the ship,pos
Jamshed went past his second ODI ton and helped Pakistan coast to a win.*,pos
India's bowlers and fielders delivered the win,pos
"There were a couple of missed chances - Dhoni dropped Misbah off Jadeja and Rahane dropped Hafeez off Ashwin, but those were rare blemishes on an otherwise great day on the field for India",pos
"Young Shami Ahmed and Bhuvneshwar Kumar set it up with a superb spell at the top, and the bowlers who followed just continued",pos
"Jadeja's 1/19 from 10 overs, Ishant's 3/36 and Ashwin's 2/47 say that it was a great teamwork from the bowlers.",pos
He was brilliant right through the game and ended up with 9 wickets in the match,pos
A superb century from Hughes and outstanding batting efforts from Bailey and Hussey set them up for a huge score on the board,pos
Philip Hughes' hundred proved to be a big difference in the end,pos
The Australian bowlers mixed it up very well,pos
Xavier Doherty stood out and his 3 wickets broke the spine of the Sri Lankan batting.,pos
Pakistan have demolished South Africa here,pos

He took four wickets in seven balls as South Africa collapsed,pos
"The other bowlers, especially Mohammad Hafeez, ran through the tail and in the end, Pakistan have emerged victorious by a margin of 95 runs.",pos
A captain's knock from Misbah,pos
He led the chase with his usual calmness and with a cool head,pos
Hafeez gave them a decent start and Younis and Malik put together vital stands with Misbah,pos
So a fantastic game of cricket comes to an end,pos
They got off to a good start with Mohammad Hafeez batting sensibly alongside Kamran Akmal before suddenly losing their way,pos
Shahid Afridi raised hopes with a quickfire knock,pos
Eventually they held their nerve to go 2-1 up in the 5-match series.,pos
They had the visitors in trouble at 33/3 before a superb 153 run stand between Misbah and Farhat led Pakistan on the recovery path,pos
"Both batsmen missed out on their tons, Pakistan endured nervy times as usual before limping past the winning post.",pos
A complete hammering,pos
"Only 33.1 overs were bowled today, which is less than a complete T20 game! This should completely demoralise the visitors",pos
They were bowled out for just 70 in under 24 overs and Australia had no problems getting to the target,pos
"Glenn Maxwell had some fun in the middle and slogged his way to a half century, but the star of the day is undoubtedly Starc",pos
His 5 for 20 completely blew away West Indies.,pos
A convincing win in the end for Australia,pos
"Starc was the chief destroyer once again, picking up 5 wickets",pos
He rocked the visitors early with 3 wickets,pos
"Powell resisted well with a wonderfully crafted 83, he was well supported by Dwayne Bravo who made an attractive 45",pos
 330 was a huge target but West Indies were in the game for a large part of the chase,pos
The Bravos put on a century stand and set up a very good platform but the big hitters couldn't do much,pos
His double strike in the 38th over took the life out of the West Indies chase.,pos
A comfortable victory for Australia in the end,pos
"Their batsmen set it up led by the Man of the Match, Adam Voges",pos
The chase was never going to be easy but West Indies began in earnest,pos
Until the halfway point they were well and truly in the game,pos
Balls being skied to the fielder and credit to the England bowlers as well for banging the ball in and generating extra bounce,pos
In the end skipper Stuart Broad led from the front with a four wicket haul and that pretty much sums up a fantastic day for England,pos
New Zealand finish a superb win over the visitors after a blitzkreig by their skipper Brendon McCullum,pos

England have dominated the whole match,pos
"After the bowlers put up a clinical performance, the batsmen played with a lot of maturity",pos

So the West Indies take a 1-0 lead in this 3-match series,pos
"Sunil Narine bagged three wickets, while Dwayne Bravo and Andre Russell bagged two each.",pos
A clinical performance from West Indies has helped them win the 3-match series 3-0,pos
But Darren Bravo played the sheet anchor role and stayed unbeaten on 72 till the end to see them through,pos
"Powell gave him a good company, but was again out to a loose shot",pos
"Yet another comfortable win for the West Indies, Zimbabwe were never really in the hunt, wickets at regular intervals pegged them back big time as the hosts swept the series 2-0.",pos
"After all the drama with the floodlights, the second innings started and it was going only Sri Lanka's way",pos
Janith Perera and Tillakaratne Dilshan started off with a bang and were going over ten runs per over,pos
"But even as the former departed, Dilshan combined well with Kumar Sangakkara and went onto make his 12th ODI hundred",pos
In the end Sri Lanka registered an emphatic 8-wicket win as they eclipsed the D/L target with 32 balls to spare.,pos
What a match it turned out to be in the end after being interrupted by the rain and at one stage it looked like it will be called off,pos
But Nasir held his nerve and stayed till the end to clinch a series levelling win for them,pos
"In the end, Bangladesh did well to come close to the Sri Lankan total and this was also their highest total batting second in T20Is",pos

Soon they lost wickets in a heap and once again it was Rahim who brought them back to the game with a responsible knock,pos
A convincing win in the end for Bangladesh after they survived a top order failure to post a decent score,pos
Ziaur Rahman was the wrecker-in-chief claiming his maiden 5-wicket haul to trigger the Zimbabwean collapse,pos

"They lost wickets initially, but Taylor and Williams' partnership got them back to the game, with Williams staying unbeaten till the end to help them level the series",pos
Waller also supported him well and they romped home easily in the end winning by 6 wickets.,pos
What a turnaround for Zimbabwe after they were beaten badly in the 1st ODI by 121 runs,pos
Their batsmen clicked as a unit in both the ODIs they have won and that helped them take the 3-match series 2-1,pos
Mahmudullah's late onslaught helped them to post 247,pos
