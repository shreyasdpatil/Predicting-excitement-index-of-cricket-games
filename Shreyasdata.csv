"Easy chase in the end for New Zealand. Martin Guptill has been in prime form this season and he has helped NZ draw first blood. He got some useful support from Nicol, Brendon and Williamson on the way. The SA bowlers were good but were defending a total which was under par. They will look to do better in the 2nd match at Hamilton.",New Zealand won by 6 wkts,T20,South Africa vs New Zealand,2
"A couple of partnerships was all it needed for South Africa to chase this target and they got exactly that. They were in a bit of bother when they lost their first 3 wickets but de Villiers and JP Duminy put on a steady stand and built a solid platform. Runs were coming mainly in singles and doubles but the asking rate was never allowed to climb beyond comfort. Duminy fell but du Plessis walked in and played his shots, helping himself to a fifty in company of his skipper (who reached a century himself). In the end, it turned out to be a comfortable victory for the visitors.",South Africa won by 6 wkts,ODI,South Africa vs New Zealand,3
"One has to say that the better team won today. South Africa have been better in all disciplines in this series and they have shown it today. New Zealand will rue the batting collapse that took place in the batting powerplay. This total was below-par on a flat track and Amla ensured that South Africa suffered no serious hiccups. His 92 oozed with class and he was helped by some poor fielding from the Kiwis. Nicol dropped him once while Ryder dropped Duminy. Nethula impressed with two wickets but in the end, Brendon McCullum had a poor score to defend.",South Africa won by 6 wkts,ODI,South Africa vs New Zealand,3
"Nothing went right for the Kiwis today at Auckland. They got off to a poor start and the middle order failed again in the face of some hostile bowling from Steyn, de Lange and Peterson. Amla was at his supreme best as he stroked his 18th fifty. Parnell and Albie Morkel also chipped in with some good knocks. New Zealand made a fight of it towards the end but the result was never in doubt. ",South Africa won by 5 wkts,ODI,South Africa vs New Zealand,2
"Another comprehensive win for Ireland. They have managed to chase down the target very easily. Getting 108 was always easy, but they lost quick wickets initially, but Joyce and Kevin O'Brien held the innings together with a solid stand to ensure there were no further hiccups in the chase. Kenya were outclassed in all the departments today and they will be looking to put up a much improved performance in the next match tomorrow.",Ireland won by 6 wkts,T20,Ireland vs Kenya,2
"Easy win for Ireland in the end and they take an unassailable 2-0 lead in this 3-match series. They had rested Ed Joyce today and everyone thought chasing 132 would be difficult, but Stirling batted brilliantly to stay unbeaten till the end and also notched up his highest T20I score. On the other hand Kenyans are still searching for their first win.",Ireland won by 8 wkts,T20,Ireland vs Kenya,3
"A thrilling end to the series. Ireland complete a whitewash and rout Kenya 3-0 in this 3-match T20I series. Defending a low total, they struck at regular intervals to put pressure on Kenya. But C Obuya and Mishra fought pretty well and revived them a bit with a 50 run stand for the 3rd wicket. After C Obuya got out, they missed the trick and lost wickets at regular intervals to lose the match by a narrow margin. Once again Dockrell was the pick of the bowlers. Overall, Ireland will be satisfied by their performance in this tour.",Ireland won by 2 runs,T20,Ireland vs Kenya,4
What an amazing match this turned out to be. A real rollercoaster of a ride. Both sides were in it until the last few overs when Pakistan suddenly took the game away from the hosts. Tamim set up the run chase perfectly for Bangladesh with a half century. Shakib Al Hasan then battled until the end but his partners deserted him and he had to fight as the lone ranger for his team. At the end it was the Gulldozer who came out on top and really just bowled his side to victory courtesy those terrific reverse swinging yorkers.,Pakistan won by 21 runs,ODI,Bangladesh vs Pakistan,5
"Pakistan have outclassed their opponents today. Mahela who has impressed as a captain so far looked absolutely clueless today. Sri Lanka failed to put up a challenging total on the board and despite making a few early inroads, the total was just not enough. Umar Akmal and Misbah steadied the ship after those quick losses and really took their side through till the end. Akmal perished in the process of trying to secure the bonus point but Hammad Azam came in and struck the 5th ball that he faced to the fence to secure that extra point. Sri Lanka have had a dismal Asia Cup so far and now they are more or less out of the tournament. ",Pakistan won by 6 wkts,ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,3
"A superb chase aided by some dreadful bowling has sealed a famous win. The dew played its part, but full credit to the way the Bangladeshi batsmen applied themselves. Tamim gave them the perfect start and was well supported by Jahurul. Shakib and Rahim played some stunning cameos while Nasir was a revelation.",Bangladesh won by 5 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs India,4
The win also makes it Ireland's 7th win in a row. They lost their first match against Namibia but have been unstoppable since. This win is also as comprehensive as it can get. Paul Stirling and Porterfield made light work of the chase after their bowlers' good work. Canada will find it very difficult to lift themselves up after this loss.,Ireland won by 10 wkts,T20,Canada vs Ireland,2
Hugs and fist pumps all around from the Afghanistan team. This was a thorough team effort. The bowlers led by Dawlat Zadran kept things very tight and choked Namibia. Wickets came at regular intervals and Aftab Alam struck in quick succession late in the innings to hasten proceedings. ,Afghanistan won by 47 runs,T20,Afghanistan vs Namibia,3
"Crushing win this for Ireland. Namibia were never in the game and the 2nd innings was just a mere formality for the Irish who certainly deserved their place in the mega event set to be held in September. Stirling was very impressive, but it must be said that Namibia's bowling was pedestrian. ",Ireland won by 9 wkts,T20,Ireland vs Namibia,1
"Zadran gave his side a dream start by castling Porterfield 1st ball but Stirling simply took the game away with breath-taking strokeplay. The Irish seemed well on course to canter home, but wickets off successive balls by that man - Zadran again reignited Afghanistan's hopes. But Gary Wilson stayed calm and struck some crucial blows to ensure his side had no trouble at the end.",Ireland won by 5 wkts,T20,Afghanistan vs Ireland,4
"A comprehensive win for the Aussies in the end. Chasing 205 was bit tricky on this slow and low pitch, But the Australian bowlers bowled a tight line and made life tougher for WI. After losing 3 early wickets Samuels and Dwayne Bravo put together an important stand of 64 for the 4th wicket, but Christian provided the much needed breathrough by removing Bravo and rest of the batsmen soon followed him by playing some loose shots. Sammy showed some fight towards the end, but he had ran out of partners and he was the last batsman to get out.",Australia won by 64 runs,ODI,Windies vs Australia,4
"This is West Indies' first win against Australia since the champions trophy game in India in 2006. A moment to remember indeed. It has been an absolute team effort. The bowlers did a great job to restrict the Aussies, and the batsmen backed it up with a good show. Powell fell early and the top order got starts. They lost a few wickets in the middle but Dwayne Bravo and Pollard put on a 64 run stand for the 5th wicket to seal the game. Bravo fell towards the end, but Pollard and Baugh finished the game.",WI won by 5 wkts,ODI,Windies vs Australia,4
"Phew! My fingers are taking a pounding here. What a match. This has been nothing short of a classic. Every over had twists, drama and brilliance. The top order collapsed in the phase of some disciplined bowling by Watson and Doherty. However, Baugh and Russell shared a 64 run stand to keep the Windies in the hunt. However, they lost wickets towards the end as the pressure mounted. Naraine stuck some lusty blows but in the end, a brain explosion resulted in the match being tied.",Match tied,ODI,Windies vs Australia,5
"So Australia have finally shown some dominance on this tour. They were a bit too loose in the ODI series, but thanks to Watson and Hussey, their batting has come into their own. Warner departed in the first over, but both the aforementioned batsmen played the big shots with ease to bring down the required run rate. Narine was the pick of the bowlers as he went for just 21 runs in 4 overs, but could not pick any wickets. Overall a bullying win for Australia",Australia won by 8 wkts,T20,Windies vs Australia,2
"Fidel Edwards sent back Watson early but Warner kept them in the game with a blazing fifty. However, some brilliant fielding from Dwayne Bravo resulted in Warner being run-out and West Indies came back in the game. Marlon Samuels and Fidel bowled a wonderful 18th and 19th over as they took wickets and gave away few runs. In the end, the West Indies held their nerve as they clinched the match by 14 runs to level the series 1-1. ",West Indies won by 14 runs,T20,Windies vs Australia,4
"Today's match saw fireworks from the South African batsmen and just when the Indian batsmen, especially Gambhir, were beginning to display theirs, rain dampened them out. Ontong played a blinder at the end to boost the score above the 200 mark. During India's chase, Gambhir playing some sublime strokes to help India stay on par even as Uthappa, at the other end, struggled to time the ball well. Although the required rate was high, India were looking set to get close to it. Unfortunately, rain had the final laugh, and it meant that South Africa won the game. They haven't had much luck with the Duckworth and Lewis in the past, but today it went their way.",South Africa won by 11 runs (D/L method),T20,South Africa vs India,3
"A clinical performance from England today has helped them rout WI by a comfortable margin. Chasing 288 was tough and West Indies needed one batsman to score big, but that didn't happen even though Smith started off aggressively and got to a quickfire fifty. None of the other batsmen supported him well and rain arrived to stop the game. Upon resumption, Samuels started off well with some big hits, but they soon lost wickets in a heap and folded up cheaply. Darren Bravo also came down the order because of a groin injury and that didn't help their cause. England go one up in this 3-match series.",England won by 114 runs (D/L method),ODI,England vs Windies,2
"West Indies never seemed to be in the game, even when Dwayne Bravo, Keiron Pollard and Darren Sammy scored some quick runs in their batting powerplay. It was England throughout the day starting with some splendid swing bowling by Anderson, Finn and Broad and ending with some clinical one day batting by Cook, Bell and Trott. The target could have been tricky if they had lost a few early wickets, but Bell and Cook did not give even half chances for the visitors to grab. Cook played a few eye-catching and aggressive strokes and scored his 5th ODI ton. Narine failed to inspire once again and the rest of the bowlers, save for Best, looked flat throughout the day. ",England won by 8 wkts,ODI,England vs Windies,2
"A high scoring game and England emerge winners once again. 173 was a stiff target but Bopara and Hales made it look too easy. They ran hard, converted singles into doubles and kept finding the boundary regularly. Hales deserved a century but fell agonisingly short by just 1 run, but did enough to ensure a win for England.",England won by 7 wkts,T20,England vs Windies,5
This is now the lowest T20 total in Sri Lanka. The hosts have really fought very well to defend what looked to be a modest total. Pakistan's batting was all over the place and none of the batsmen looked very comfortable against the short delivery. Kulasekara gave his side the perfect start by taking two wickets off the first two balls of the chase. Ahmed Shehzad finished up as the highest scorer amongst both teams but his innings of 36 came at a snail's pace and lasted 42 balls. Yet again Pakistan have bowled well but haven't finished up on top owing to some poor shot selection. Some credit obviously has to be given to Sri Lanka for their bowling and sharpness in the field.,Sri Lanka won by 37 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,5
"The first leg of the tour ends at 1-1. Some positives for both teams though the batting will be a cause of concern for either team's management. The bowling was superb by either sides with Sami joining the party with some outstanding pace. Afridi has to be the story of the day, he came in with Pakistan struggling. His fifty propelled the visitors to a fighting total which was a bridge too far for the visitors on a difficult track.",Pakistan won by 23 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,5
"A clinical performance has helped Pakistan win this match by 6 wickets. Chasing a low total, they lost Azhar Ali and Younis early, but Hafeez and Misbah held the innings together with a fifty plus stand, which was instrumental in their win today. With this win, Pakistan have now won 9 of their past 11 ODIs against Sri Lanka. This match also will be remembered as one of the longest matches played as it was interrupted thrice by rain today and not many overs were reduced. Sri Lanka's batting let them down and they will hope to put up a much better performance in the next ODI.",Pakistan won by 6 wickets (D/L method),ODI,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,5
"Convincing and clinical showing by Sri Lanka. After the mediocre performance in the first ODI, the batsmen came back well to put on a score of 280. Dilshan batted really well, carrying his bat through and in the process scored a hundred. Pakistan looked to be in the game when Misbah and Azhar Ali were batting in the middle, but once the skipper fell, the other batsmen followed him back to the pavilion. After Umar Akmal had to return back thanks to a horrendous decision, the onus was on Afridi to take his side home. But a brilliant catch from Sangakkara sent him back for just 17 and the game pretty much ended then and there. ",Sri Lanka won by 76 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,5
"What a game this has been. Indeed it has been a great exhibition for the 50 over game. Pakistan, for the second time in the series, were coasting along in the middle overs. Like in the 2nd ODI, it was the skipper Misbah and Azhar Ali who were anchoring the chase. But unfortunately for them, the batting powerplay turned out to be a nightmare as they lost Misbah and then Umar Akmal during that passage of play. It only went from bad to worse as Thissara Perera proceeded to pick a hat-trick in the 41st over and Pakistan collapsed from 166/2 to 199 all out. Perera once again shone through with 4 wickets, but you have got to hand it to Mahela's intuitive captaincy. He kept the pressure on the visitors despite a 113 run 3rd wicket stand. Azhar Ali once again was the lone ranger and carried his bat through, scoring an unbeaten and defiant 81 in the process.",Sri Lanka won by 44 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,5
Sri Lanka stuttered in their chase early as they lost their openers without doing much damage. Then Sanga and Chandimal stitched a partnership and they found it hard to negotiate the spinners in the middle overs. Misbah lost the plot before the toss only when he left out Ajmal and got in Sami in his place. This pitch was conducive for spin bowling and they were one spinner short. They were also pretty ordinary in the field and too many runs were conceded as a result of which Sri Lankans got away when they needed runs. Mathews played an innings of substance as he single-handedly took his team through even though he lost partners at the other end. Sami's figures are the most expensive by a Pakistani in Sri Lanka.,Sri Lanka won by 2 wkts,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,5
It has been a commanding performance from South Africa. Ashraful played some good strokes but he played a loose shot and was dismissed. The middle order failed to put up much of a fight. Mahmudullah and Rahim sparkled towards the end. Rahim capitalized on some bad bowling from Wayne Parnell as he scored a fifty. The South Africans were a bit off the boil in the final overs and they will look to overcome that.,South Africa won by 39 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs South Africa,5
"What a performance by Zimbabwe. Mpofu bowled wonderfully at the start. He cleverly mixed his pace and the South African batsmen found the going tough. Cremer then flummoxed the Proteas with his leg breaks and googly. Colin Ingram put up a bit of a fight after surviving a dropped chance on 0. However, in the end, it was a bridge too far for South Africa and they have suffered defeat by 29 runs.",Zimbabwe won by 29 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs South Africa,5
"An easy win in the end for the Proteas and they take on Zimbabwe again tomorrow in the finals. They looked a better unit today and their fielding and bowling was much better than the previous matches. Parnell was the the pick of the bowlers, taking 3 for 16 from his 4 overs and that was the difference between the two sides today. SA had to chase down the target in 15 overs to knock Zimbabwe out of the tournament, but ZIM spinners bowled some tight overs in the middle to make sure they reach the finals.",South Africa won by 6 wkts,T20,Zimbabwe vs South Africa,5
"Excellent win for the hosts, truly deserving. Taylor led the way with a captain's knock, he was all class today, wonder why he is never considered for a contract in any T20 franchises across the world? That is for later though, Masakadza was scratchy but did well to stay and aid his skipper. Good practise ahead of the T20 WC for them. Gary Kirsten and Allan Donald will have some work, SA did miss some of their stars but their efforts were patchy in this tournament.",Zimbabwe won by 9 wkts,T20,Zimbabwe vs South Africa,3
"An easy win in the end for England. They bowled well as a unit and successfully defended the total. After they were put in by Australia, they got off to a solid start, but lost quick wickets in the middle. Morgan took the centre stage thereafter and played an incredible innings to help England to a decent total. Australia lost Watson cheaply, but Warner and Bailey stitched together a solid partnership. They lost both set batsmen quickly and only Clarke showed some character in the middle, with the other batsmen failing to make any valuable contribution. Wade was playing well for his 27, but a terrible mix-up in the middle cut short his innings and that was the last nail in the coffin for Australia.",England won by 15 runs,ODI,England vs Australia,4
"Once again, England have outplayed Australia in all departments. Bell looked in wonderful touch as he stroked his 21st ODI fifty. Clint McKay bowled with a lot of heart but he found no support from the other bowlers. Ravi Bopara scored his first ever half-century against Australia and along with Morgan, he helped England go 2-0 up in the series.",England won by 6 wkts,ODI,England vs Australia,3
"Yet another convincing victory for the hosts. The bowlers set it up by restricting Australia in the first half and the batsmen made the chase look easy. Bell and Trott got half centuries and Bopara contributed too. Australia were never in the game, and to make it worse, suffered a couple of injury blows too (Watson and Lee). ",England won by 8 wkts,ODI,England vs Australia,2
"West Indies have outclassed New Zealand in all departments. 210 was always going to be a difficult target on a pitch that got slower. Nicol tried to be aggressive but he had no support from the other batsmen. Narine had another impressive match. Taylor retired hurt on 10 to give New Zealand more anxious moments. Oram provided a flourish towards the end but in the end, it was a bridge too far for the Kiwis as they lost the match by 56 runs.",West Indies won by 56 runs, T20,Windies vs New Zealand,3
"Clinical performance by West Indies. This has been a comprehensive win for them. New Zealand were never in the game after Narine rattled them early on. Badree, Samuels and Bravo did their bit too. It was a complete team performance and this side looks the team to beat. New Zealand looked down and out from the first ball and they will have to ask some really tough questions.",West Indies won by 61 runs, T20,Windies vs New Zealand,2
"It has been an efficient performance from the West Indies. Gayle and Dwayne Smith carted the New Zealand bowlers to all parts of the ground as their partnership propelled West Indies along. At one point, one felt that the match could be abandoned due to rain but luckily it blew away. The Kiwi bowlers lacked intensity and failed to create pressure.",WI won by 9 wkts (D/L method), ODI,Windies vs New Zealand,2
"West Indies have completed a comprehensive victory. After setting a huge total, the pressure was always on the Kiwis. Guptill started things off on a positive note by getting to his half century but couldn't convert it into a big innings. New Zealand always needed someone to play right through the match and strike at a good rate, however, they were always left wanting. Williamson and Watling also got half centuries but the lack of support and the lack of quick runs found New Zealand short of the target. West Indies now enjoy a 2-0 lead in this five match series.",West Indies won by 55 runs, ODI,Windies vs New Zealand,3
Not a lot of people would have placed their money on a 88 run victory for New Zealand at the start of the game. They had had a very poor tour so far and were showing very little signs of any improvement but somehow everything clicked for them in this game. Nathan McCullum scored a gutsy fifty to prop up the NZ innings early on. The bowlers seemed buoyed by the effort and put in a clinical performance to shoot West Indies out for their lowest ever total at St. Kitts.,New Zealand won by 88 runs, ODI,Windies vs New Zealand,4
"Tino Best and Sunil Narine were the absolute stars in the bowling line-up. The NZ batsmen had no clue against Narine while Best troubled them with his hostile pace and bounce. Ross Taylor played a fantastic knock and scored his 6th ODI century. However, there was no support from the other end and in the end New Zealand succumbed to a 24 run defeat. ",West Indies won by 24 runs, ODI,Windies vs New Zealand,3
"Wild celebrations in the Windies camp and they thoroughly deserve it. This is a much better outfit as they were bolstered by the comeback of Gayle. Narine was the wrecker-in-chief in this match, taking his first 5-wicket haul in ODIs, but all through the series he bamboozled the Kiwi batsmen as they struggled to score runs against him. On the other hand, Kiwis have a lot of thinking to do as they were hampered by the injuries and their in-experienced middle order was exposed against a strong WI attack. Only Taylor and Williamson played well, but they didn't get much support from the other end.",West Indies won by 20 runs, ODI,Windies vs New Zealand,4
"That ends this tie, and Scotland were the better side in all departments. The Scots had to chase a low total and they decided to play aggressively in order to do so. It was MacLeod who held the innings together and led his side to a big win. Canada's bowlers and fielders looked quite jaded for most parts of the match, perhaps they couldn't get over the fact that they were actually finally playing a game.",Scotland won by 4 wkts,ODI,Scotland vs Canada,3
"After putting on a small total on board, the Scots needed to do bowl really well to win the game. But they were blown away by Nowroz Mangal. The opener started off silently, but launched a vicious assault to go from 66 to 101 in the space of 9 balls which left the bowlers and fielders surprised and shocked. This is a big win for the Asian side and one that will give them a lot of confidence.",Afghanistan won by 7 wkts,ODI,Afghanistan vs Scotland,3
"Easy win for Afghanistan in the end. The lack of bowling discipline from the Scots cost them in the end. Mohammad Shahzad got the right start for the Afghans with a blazing 48 while Nabi made sure that there were no hiccups towards the end with a sparkling fifty. Kyle Coetzer's fine 133 went in vain, his 1st century at this level.",Afghanistan won by 5 wkts,ODI,Afghanistan vs Scotlands,3
"Finally Scotland held their nerve to prevail in a close match. The match went into the reserve day as most part of yesterday was washed out due to rain. The play was interrupted again due to rain today and in the end, Scotland who were ahead according to D/L method had to get around 33 runs in less than 7 overs to gain crucial 2 points.",Scotland won by 4 wickets (D/L method),ODI,Scotland vs Kenya,2
"Emphatic win by the Irish here! They are just one win away from qualifying for the ICC World Cup 2015. After putting up a decent total batting first, they came on to put up a brilliant bowling show. The star of today's game was Kevin O'Brien, who had earlier chipped in with a wonderful cameo of 32 to accelerate the run-rate. He then came on to put up his best bowling performance picking up 4 important wickets. In the end, the Dutch could not hold on and crumbled against the Irish pace.",Ireland won by 88 runs,ODI,Netherlands vs Ireland,3
This is the first time that a game is tied in the ICC World Cricket League Championship. Netherlands should have won it easily after being well set at one stage. They played a little slowly as the innings neared its death. But credit to the Ireland bowlers for making life difficult for the batsmen. It was down to 13 runs required off the last over. John Mooney was given to duties and he started off in grand fashion conceding just 2 runs in the first four balls. But Rippon held his nerve and managed to stun the Irish by his lusty hits in the last two balls.,Match tied,ODI,Netherlands vs Ireland,5
"What a spell by Mahmudullah! He completely changed the equation in favor of Bangladesh. He gave just 4 runs in the 18th over and followed it up with a brilliant final over to help Bangladesh clinch the series. Ireland kept the required rate under check for most parts of the chase but couldn't quite finish it off. Stirling, Joyce and Wilson got starts but at least one of them should have carried on and seen them through.",Bangladesh won by 1 run, T20,Ireland vs Bangladesh,5
"Superb show from Bangladesh. They seemed to be down and out at one stage, but fought back superbly. Mashrafe was the man. He followed up his 4 wickets with some blistering blows to seal the isue.",Bangladesh won by 2 wkts, T20,Ireland vs Bangladesh,4
"A comfortable win in the end for the Proteas and they go one up in the series and dethrone England to claim the no.1 spot in ODIs also. They were in the driver's seat after they posted a huge total on the board and that was mainly to a master piece innings of 150 by the modern day run machine Amla. The pitch was always expected to take turn under the lights and even the part time SA spinners got vicious turn and English batsmen had no answer to that and lost wickets in a heap. Only Morgan fought a hard battle, but he didn't get any support from the other end. Samit entertained the crowds with a stroke-filled 45, but that was not enough for them to get anywhere close to the SA total.",South Africa won by 80 runs, ODI,England vs South Africa,3
"England have sealed a much-needed win. Jonathan Trott and Eoin Morgan stroked some wonderful fifties to guide England along. Despite some good bowling from Peterson and Parnell, the target of 212 was never going to be daunting.",England won by 4 wkts, ODI,England vs South Africa,3
"Storming finish by England and they retain the No.1 rank irrespective of the next match. South Africa were always playing the second fiddle after losing the toss, they pottered around to 220. The bowling barring Steyn was lacklustre. Bell played the anchor with an attractive 88 while Trott, Morgan and Kieswetter chipped in with useful scores.",England won by 6 wkts, ODI,England vs South Africa,2
England got a few early wickets but they could not break this unbeaten 90 run stand. Kallis and Duminy played very well while the England bowlers struggled. Dernbach and Finn were the pick of the bowlers but no one else supported them.,South Africa won by 7 wkts, T20,England vs South Africa,3
"A convincing win for the T20 champions and they go into the T20 World Cup with lot of confidence. They were sent into bat after the match was reduced to 11 overs due to rain. They didn't get off to a electrifying start, but the penultimate over from Parnell changed the course of the game as Buttler plundered 30 runs. Chasing on this pitch under the lights was always going to be difficult. Swann and Briggs got the ball to turn viciously and the Proteas never got going. Even their run machine Amla couldn't get the odd boundaries regularly. The three match series is drawn 1-1 after the second match was washed out due to rain. But overall a poor performance from the Proteas in this series",England won by 28 runs, T20,England vs South Africa,2
"Phew! India made a meal of this in the final overs. Sangakkara played a solid knock and Thisara chipped in with a wonderful cameo. But, in the end, the asking rate was too much and Sri Lanka were always behind the eight ball. Malinga got some batting practice towards the end. Barring Irfan Pathan and Ashwin who bowled well, all the other Indian bowlers were carted around. The Indian fielding was also very sloppy and they have a lot of work to do ahead of the second ODI.",India won by 21 runs, ODI,Sri Lanka vs India,3
"That seals a comprehensive win for Sri Lanka. They have absolutley demolished India in this game and have come back in a very strong manner. After skittling India out for a low score, the Lankans made merry with the bat and piled on the pressure right from the start. Dilshan played his natural game by going after the bowling while Tharanga displayed some immaculate timing. Both batsmen got to their half centuries and Tharanga held fort until the end to see his side through to victory.",Sri Lanka won by 9 wkts, ODI,Sri Lanka vs India,3
"That seals India's 400th ODI victory and it gives them an unassailable 3-1 series lead. Virat Kohli and Raina played magnificently to take India home. Sri Lanka started off very well by dismissing Gambhir early and left India struggling at 60 for 3. Manoj Tiwary and Kohli then put on a partnership of 49, before Jeevan Mendis got a brave lbw decision in his favour to dismiss Tiwary. It was Raina then who partnered Kohli till the end and kept his composure. Credit this time though has to go to Kohli, who stuck at it right through the innings and piled on yet another century against Sri Lanka. Once he and Raina had settled in, they simply tore through the bowling line up. Eventually India cruised through to 6 wicket victory.",India won by 6 wkts, ODI,Sri Lanka vs India,3
"Historic moment this for Scotland. This is their first victory against a Test playing nation. The Scotland bowlers kept things tight. Haq and Davey picked up three wickets and none of the Bangladesh batsmen got going. This is a deserved victory for Scotland and for Bangladesh, they have come crashing down to earth with a bang after clean-sweeping Ireland.",Scotland won by 34 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs Scotland,3
"What a way to finish the game and what a way to come back after their loss to Scotland. Bangladesh will feel that they have finally redeemed themselves. They were always on top of their opponents in the chase. Tamim Iqbal played aggressively right from the start and never really let the bowlers settle down. Shakib got out a little early and for a moment the Dutch would have felt that they could stage a come back but those hopes were washed away by a sparkling cameo from Rahim. At the end of the day, there was a clear difference in the quality of the two sides and that resulted in Bangladesh running away with the game.",Bangladesh won by 8 wkts, T20,Netherlands vs Bangladesh,2
"Netherlands level the series 1-1. Bangladesh will look back at their batting collapse. They recovered to post 128 but that didn't prove to be enough. Netherlands struggled to get partnerships but Swart stayed on and almost took them home. He fell towards the end but the tail kept their nerves, and Ahsan Malik finished the game with a last ball boundary. Netherlands will never forget this game of cricket - a thrilling and much deserved win for them.",Netherlands won by 1 wkt, T20,Netherlands vs Bangladesh,5
MS Dhoni will come in for much criticism. 22 at less than run a ball has cost India but enough credit should be given to the Kiwi bowlers. The cutters worked very well as the ball got older and the big hits just failed to come off. Yuvraj Singh managed a good show in his much awaited comeback but he will be a very disappointed man after failing to take India through. Virat Kohli was outstanding too and India were in complete control with him out in the middle. The win coming from behind will be a huge boost for the tourists. They clinch the series too with that.,New Zealand won by 1 run, T20,India vs New Zealand,5
"Professional performance from Australia. They took their time while batting before exploding in the end to get 272. The reply from AFG was entertaining. Stanikzai showed good application in making a career best 66, Nabi chipped in with 46 and the tail swung around merrily to take Afghanistan beyond 200. They will have learnt quite a lot from today's match, they were beaten but certainly not disgraced.",Australia won by 66 runs,ODI,Afghanistan vs Australia,2
"Oh boy, Australia had to fight every inch of their way to get to this target. The spinners maintained the pressure throughout as Australia found the going tough. Saeed Ajmal, in particular, confounded the Australians with his doosra. However, Michael Clarke and George Bailey showed admirable composure by striking solid fifties as they guided Australia to a four wicket win. ",Australia won by 4 wkts, ODI ,Pakistan vs Australia,3
"Comprehensive win from Pakistan. They were lucky to lose the toss, their spinners enjoyed bowling on a slow and low track. Chasing 249, Hafeez and Jamshed got them off to a breezy start. Jamshed's innings was the cornerstone, he played some scintillating strokes before the heat took a toll on him. Azhar Ali and Misbah then made sure that the win was achieved without any more fuss. ",Pakistan won by 7 wkts, ODI,Pakistan vs Australia,2
"Good chase from Australia. The openers started positively, the middle order stuttered in the face of some magic from Ajmal before Mike Hussey took over. He was lucky when Pakistan failed to review an LBW appeal on 0, added some vital runs with Wade to settle the nerves before Maxwell took over to seal the win. He finished the match in some style and also completed his maiden ODI fifty.",Australia won by 3 wkts,ODI,Pakistan vs Australia,2
"Australia didn't even compete. They were bowled out for their second lowest score in T20Is and were never in a position to challenge Pakistan after that. Hafeez, Imran Nazir and Kamran Akmal enjoyed some batting practice and Pakistan finished the match with 31 balls to spare. They will be happy with Kamran Akmal's contribution in particular; he looked aggressive and confident and helped himself to some runs as well. The lesser said about Australia the better. This is their biggest loss in terms of balls to spare.",Pakistan won by 7 wkts,T20,Pakistan vs Australia,2
"Oh boy, that concludes what has been a fantastic match. This is probably where experience counts. Gul bowled a fantastic over while Cummins showed his inexperience and sprayed it all over the place. Umar Akmal and Razzaq held their cool and scored the required 12 runs to clinch the series 2-0. This is the sixth tied match in T20Is.",Match tied (Pakistan won the one-over eliminator),T20,Pakistan vs Australia,5
"A comprehensive performance by the Aussies. Though the scorecard for the series will say 2-1, this win is likely to keep them in really high spirits. The openers Watson and Warner clicked big time and showed Dubai and those watching on TV, what destruction they could cause. Later, Starc and Cummins, with their pace and swing, literally ran through the top order and reminded Pakistan's fans just how unpredictable their side could be. Just three Pakistani batsmen crossed into double figures and none of the three scored at faster than a run a ball. In one word, Australia's performance today can be termed as 'Dominating'.",Australia won by 94 runs,T20,Pakistan vs Australia,2
This match will be remembered for the performance of both Ajantha and Jeevan Mendis. The Zimbabwe batsmen failed to negotiate these two and they capitulated tamely. Ajantha Mendis now has the best haul in T20 cricket with match figures of 4-2-8-6. Jeevan Mendis continued his wonderful match as he snapped up three wickets.,Sri Lanka won by 82 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe,3
Watson made all the difference for the Australians as they got off to a flying start and raced along to 60 in seven overs. Dockrell sent back Warner but Watson powered his way to an aggressive fifty. Australia lost a couple of wickets towards the end but White steadied the ship and helped them seal victory by 7 wickets.,Australia won by 7 wkts,T20,Australia vs Ireland,2
"The scorecard says won by 23 runs but there were a few nervous moments for India. The catching was the difference in the end. Afghanistan dropped 4 catches, while India took everything that came their way. Shahzad, Mangal and Sadiq got off to starts but none could convert it. Balaji gave the first breakthrough and that was followed by a triple strike from Yuvraj, which plucked the life out of the Afghan challenge. Mohammad Nabi fought down the order with a 17 ball 31, but when he fell to Ashwin, the game was well and truly India's.",India won by 23 runs,T20,India vs Afghanistan,2
South Africa were never going to be troubled by this paltry score. Levi and Amla ensured that they reached the target without any hiccups. Levi got to his first T20I fifty (to go along with a century) as Zimbabwe suffered their 14th consecutive loss in T20Is. This is also the second instance where a team has won by 10 wickets in all editions of this tournament.*,South Africa won by 10 wkts,T20,South Africa vs Zimbabwe,4
Bangladesh have now lost nine consecutive T20Is in all editions of this tournament. They were never in the contest once Tamim and Shakib departed cheaply. Nasir Hossain hung in there and scored a gritty fifty but he did not get support. Most of the NZ bowlers chipped in and helped the team achieve victory by 59 runs. ,New Zealand won by 59 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs New Zealand,2
"Sri Lanka were never in the match after T Dilshan was run out without facing a ball. Dilshan Munaweera looked ill at ease and failed to score freely. Nobody in the Lankan line-up could play a knock like the one played by de Villiers which ultimately made the difference. South Africa have a lot of soul-searching to do. Levi and du Plessis failed once again, while their high catching in this game has been pathetic.",South Africa won by 32 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,1
"Very good cricket from Pakistan. They batted superbly led by the impressive Nasir Jamshed. Their bowling was effective without being spectacular. Saeed Ajmal was the exception. He was brought in only in the 12th over but maintained his calm under pressure to help Pakistan get through. Taylor, Franklin and Oram struck some late blows but they were left with too much to do in the end. Pakistan will take a lot of confidence from this hard fought win.",Pakistan won by 13 runs,T20,New Zealand vs Pakistan,3
"It was a dismal performance with the ball from Bangladesh. They showed a lot of spirit with the bat, Shakib led the way there but there was no one to do a similar role with the ball. The pacers were guilty of bowling too many short deliveries. Imran Nazir put them away in style and together with Hafeez, the duo ensured that Pakistan made it through with little trouble.",Pakistan won by 8 wkts,T20,Bangladesh vs Pakistan,1
"Eoin Morgan will be a disappointed man. He has scored an unbeaten 71 off just 36 balls but even that was not enough to take England past the line. It was all because of the horror start they got - Rampaul started with a double wicket maiden and England took their own sweet time to rebuild. Bairstow in particular struggled to get going and that kept pushing up the required run rate. Hales and Morgan kept trying, and with some luck going their way, even put some pressure on West Indies, but the target was always beyond their reach.",West Indies won by 15 runs,T20,England vs Windies,3
"So, for the third time in a row, South Africa have been unable to defeat Pakistan in the T20 Cup. The Pakistani camp is absolutely thrilled to bits. After a brisk start, Pakistan lost three wickets quickly and they continued to lose wickets in the middle overs. Umar Akmal played a mature hand and guided Pakistan along. However, it was Gul's 17 ball 32 that changed the tide of the match for Pakistan. The 51 run stand between Gul and Umar Akmal made South Africa panicky as they leaked 36 runs in two overs.",Pakistan won by 2 wkts,T20,Pakistan vs South Africa,4
"England complete a convincing win over New Zealand.  Undoubtedly the star of the game was Luke Wright. While the other batsmen struggled a bit against the slow bowlers, Wright played a stunning knock, smashing five sixes and an equal number of fours in the process. None of the NZ bowlers did anything extraordinary, though their fielding was outstanding.",England won by 6 wkts,T20,England vs New Zealand,3
Sri Lanka have bossed this game and Mahela has played a perfect captain's knock. The bowlers set it up first and Mahela guided them with the bat. Sangakkara gave his skipper some solid support as the hosts chased the low target down with absolute ease.,Sri Lanka won by 9 wkts,T20,Sri Lanka vs Windies,2
"Another convincing performance from the Aussies. It was the Shane Watson show once again today. 2 wickets with the ball and a 47 ball blitz which saw him scoring 70. South Africa have much to think. Their ground fielding has been excellent in parts, but their catching has been awful. They still have an outside chance to make the semis. For that they will want India to win against Pakistan.",Australia won by 8 wkts,T20,Australia vs South Africa,2
"Convincing win in the end for Sri Lanka. They have Lasith Malinga to thank for, he ripped through the top order in his first spell and returned at crucial times to dig a hole in the England line-up. He was well supported by Kulasekara and Dananjaya as Sri Lanka wrapped it up in style. Samit Patel was the lone batsman to show some fight with a spunky 67, Swann threatened to upset West Indies with a fine cameo but it was too little and too late.",Sri Lanka won by 19 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs England,3
The Pakistani spinners proved to be a handful on this pitch. Raza Hasan and Saeed Ajmal were too good for the Australian top order. Watson failed for the first time and it took a brilliant fifty from Michael Hussey to guide Australia past the target of 112 which was needed for them to qualify for the semi-finals. ,Pakistan won by 32 runs,T20,Australia vs Pakistan,3
"Excellent cricket from Sri Lanka. They have managed to defend a average score. The bowling was outstanding, were backed up by some athletic fielding, the pitch did play its part as it made the batsmen struggle to play their shots with any fluency. Pakistan never looked like they would come anywhere close to the target, Nazir gave them a decent start but the middle order struggled as the spinners came on. The death blow was the twin dismissals of skipper Hafeez and the woefully out of form Afridi. Umar Akmal fought well but neither he nor Umar Gul could do little to snatch victory.",Sri Lanka won by 16 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,3
"It has been a wonderful performance from the West Indies. They were much better in all departments today. Gayle and Pollard took the game away as their big hits took West Indies beyond 200. Australia never got going and they were restricted to 43/6. Bailey came in and scored his first T20I fifty. However, the asking rate was too much as Australia suffered a 74 run defeat. It will be Sri Lanka versus West Indies on 7th.",West Indies won by 74 runs,T20,Australia vs Windies,3
New Zealand did very well with the bat. In fact they got to their highest ever score against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. They would have backed themselves to put up a fight with that total. Sri Lanka's chase was held together by Dilshan and Jayawardene. The former was struggling but still stuck in to put on a good stand. They did well to be ahead of the D/L par score when the rain came in and deservingly went 1-0 up in the series.,Sri Lanka win by 14 runs (D/L method),ODI,Sri Lanka vs New Zealand,3
"The rain-marred game finally managed to produce some entertaining cricket. Watling started it off with a splendid knock and Sri Lanka had a stiff target to chase. It became even more difficult after they lost some quick wickets early on. Dilshan had hung on in the initial stages and with Mathews for company, began to open up further. The dew played a factor too but NZ were in the game until it went into the last 10 overs. The experienced duo upped the ante just when SL needed it and cruised to a comfortable victory.",Sri Lanka won by 7 wkts (D/L method),ODI,Sri Lanka vs New Zealand,3
"Sri Lanka never looked in any strife though it must be said that Boult and Southee beat the bat on numerous occasions during their opening spell. Chandimal lived a charmed life and Boult could have got him at least a couple of times. After the initial difficult phase, the chase became relatively easy and though the batsmen slowed down considerably towards the end, the job was complete with ease.",Sri Lanka won by 7 wkts (D/L method),ODI,Sri Lanka vs New Zealand,2
Bangladesh have outplayed West Indies in all departments. 200 was never going to be too much and it became very easy after Tamim Iqbal started the chase with an aggressive half century. All the batsmen contributed in the chase which is a very good sign ahead of the series. Nothing much to say about the West Indies. They were totally outclassed and will have to forget this game before the next one.,Bangladesh won by 7 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs Windies,2
"A spectacular victory for Bangladesh. They have trumped their fancied opponents by a massive 160 run margin. West Indies were never in the chase right from the first ball, they lost their openers very early and never recovered from there on. The spinners came into the party with Gazi and Razzak taking three wickets each. This is also Bangladesh's biggest ever win in terms of runs.",Bangladesh won by 160 runs,ODI,Bangladesh vs Windies,3
"A chase anchored by Marlon Samuels. He was well supported by Kieron Powell as the visitors cruised along. They lost a few wickets in a hurry towards the end but the presence of Samuels was vital. Bangladesh bowled their hearts out, especially the spinners who made the ball talk despite all the dew. The series now stands at 2-1 in favour of the hosts with two still to play.",West Indies won by 4 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs Windies,3
Bangladesh's jinx at Mirpur continues. They have blown away a 2-0 lead and will now head to tommorrow's final match with all to play for. Sammy was the star of the show today. He followed his unbeaten 60 with an incisive burst that saw him grab 3 top order wickets. He was well supported by Roach who took 2 as the hosts slid to 13/5. The match was over and only a fighting 56 from Mahmudullah delayed the final outcome.,West Indies won by 75 runs,ODI,Bangladesh vs Windies,2
"The Bangladesh batting collapsed again as Roach ripped through the top order. However, a fantastic 81 run stand between Mahmudullah and Rahim put Bangladesh back on track. However, they lost quick wickets again and it took a 53 run stand between Nasir Hossain and Mominul Haque to get Bangladesh closer to victory. In the end, Nasir Hossain held firm and scored the winning runs to seal a 3-2 victory.",Bangladesh won by 2 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs Windies,3
"Bangladesh should not be satisfied with this performance. When you lose just 1 wicket, you should expect to score more than just 179 on a flat track. Mahmudullah went past a half century and Tamim Iqbal almost made a century, but they missed out on a lot of scoring chances in the middle overs. At least 10 full tosses were wasted and Bangladesh have been made to pay for that. For West Indies, it was Gayle's off spin which made the difference. He conceded only 18 runs in his 4 overs in the middle and changed the game their way. Bangladesh will look back at the game and reckon that the last over from Rubel Hossain where he conceded 29 runs was the turning point.*",West Indies won by 18 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs Windies,3
"England were never in the game after they lost a flurry of wickets post a strong start. On a batting paradise a score well in excess of 180 runs was required. The fact that India's batsmen came out attacking made things difficult for them as well. Yuvraj Singh dazzled with an all-round performance and should surely be the Man of the Match. In retrospect, England will feel that they were about 20 runs short and bowled one wide too many.",India won by 5 wkts,T20,India vs England,2
England have squared the series 1-1. The chase was very professional from England. The openers gave them a great start. Yuvraj Singh pulled things back with a miserly spell where he picked up 3 wickets as well. A lot depended on Morgan who came in late to take England across and he did it in style.,England won by 6 wkts,T20,India vs England,2
"India will look back at the last two overs which went for 38 runs. Apart from that, there was nothing much to separate between the teams. Except Kohli, all the recognised batsmen got going and looked like playing a big knock while they were in the middle. Yuvraj and Raina played gorgeous strokes, but got out at crucial junctures. Dhoni got the crowd going with 4 sixes, but hit one straight to the fielder. Indeed that was the story of the innings as most of the batsmen gifted away their wickets. For England, it was off-spinner James Tredwell who was a revelation as he brought up his best ODI figures. Dernbach was costly, but picked up the big wicket of Dhoni.",England won by 9 runs,ODI,India vs England,5
"Ravindra Jadeja had a day to remember. He contributed with bat, ball and on the field to help India to a big win. The England chase never really got going. Bhuvaneshwar Kumar was the star early on. His 10 over spell right at the top ensured that England were always on the backfoot. On a track that was aiding the spinners, his spell of 3/30 was worth its weight in gold. Kevin Pietersen was the only batsman who looked in any sort of comfort but after his dismissal the Indian spinners got stuck in and never let the pressure off.",India won by 127 runs,ODI,India vs England,3
"It has been a professional batting performance from India. Rohit Sharma surprised one and all by responding to his skipper's call. He played a lot of wonderful strokes and missed out on a well-deserved hundred, courtesy a poor decision. England will rue the missed chance when Raina was caught at slip, but Finn had knocked off the bails and it was called a dead ball. Raina was on 42 then and it could have been the turning point. As far as the England bowling is concerned, it was Tredwell again who chipped in with the wickets. But Dernbach and Bresnan could do little. Except Finn, all the bowlers were expensive which did not help.",India won by 5 wkts,ODI,India vs England,3
"This win will restore some pride for England. Ian Bell was clinical in the chase. India fought hard with the ball. Ishant Sharma, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar and Ravindra Jadeja were impressive but the score was just not big enough to defend. The game was heading for a tight finish going into the last 10 overs but the dominant stand between Eoin Morgan and Ian Bell sealed it for England. They will be elated to go home on a winning note.",England won by 7 wkts,ODI,India vs England,3
"A straightforward win for the hosts despite missing many of their batting stars. A superb century from Hughes and outstanding batting efforts from Bailey and Hussey set them up for a huge score on the board. The bowlers then stood up, Tharanga and Mahela were dismissed cheaply, Dilshan and Chandimal steadied the ship before the calamitous run-out of Dilshan started the slide. Chandimal fought bravely for his 73 but got zero support at the other end. Australia go to Adelaide with a 1-0 lead.",Australia won by 107 runs,ODI ,Australia vs Sri Lanka,3
"Kushal Perera and Dilshan started the chase off well but they stuttered when the spinners came on to bowl. Doherty and Maxwell stifled the scoring rate as they picked up wickets at regular intervals. However, Mathews steadied the ship and Thisara Perera supported him well. Thisara finished off the game with a couple of sixes to help Sri Lanka go 1-0 up in the two match series.",Sri Lanka won by 5 wkts,T20,Australia vs Sri Lanka,2
A nail-biting game this. The revised target seemed to favour Australia but Sri Lanka's bowlers held their nerves and clinched the win. Bailey and Marsh got a few boundaries and took Australia to the last over. Glenn Maxwell hit consecutive fours and threatened to take the game away but he couldn't quite finish on a high.,Sri Lanka won by 2 runs ( D/L method),T20,Australia vs Sri Lanka,4
"An utterly dominant show from the hosts. The visitors never really arrived for the game. The batting was a huge let down and even though the bowlers showed some spirit, it was never going to be enough. After the loss of an early wicket, du Plessis, the first time skipper played a matured knock. Debutant, Quinton de Kock, got into his stride as well and it should give him some confidence that he stayed on till the end.",South Africa won by 8 wkts,T20,South Africa vs New Zealand,2
"Almost a one man show, that. New Zealand's innings was all about Guptill. Nicol and Brendon McCullum played their part and gave good support to Guptill as he flayed the South African attack. He hit as many as six 6s and was particularly harsh on the spinners - Peterson and Phangiso. The wet ball made it even more difficult for the Protea bowlers but they missed a few chances as well. In the end, it was a well deserved victory for New Zealand.",NZ won by 8 wickets (D/L method),T20,South Africa vs New Zealand,2
The visitors were never in the chase after Guptill and Brendon McCullum got out. Franklin was probably their last hope but even he did not inspire any confidence. The Proteas fielded like tigers and their catching was of the highest standard. Mclaren and Phangiso were the pick of the bowlers with 3 wickets each. With that South Africa win the 3 match T20I series 2-1.,South Africa won by 33 runs,T20,South Africa vs New Zealand,2
"Phew. What a chase this has been. New Zealand got off to a horrid start as the top order once again capitulated. BJ Watling and Brendon McCullum got going thanks to a gritty partnership. However, in the middle overs, they once again stuttered before Nathan McCullum played a nice cameo. The 47 run stand for the 9th wicket between Kyle Mills and James Franklin got NZ closer to the target. In the end, Mitchell McClenaghan managed to survive and Franklin scored the winning runs as they won the first ODI at Paarl by one wicket.",New Zealand won by 1 wkt,ODI,South Africa vs New Zealand,4
"New Zealand have fought admirably. Credit to them for keeping up the pressure and bowling and fielding brilliantly. They have proven yet again that catches and sharp fielding can help win you a match. But it has to be said that it was South Africa's match to lose. They were 167/1 at one stage, cruising along with Smith and Colin Ingram at the crease. But thanks to 5 run outs, they eventually fell 27 run short. Mills was the pick of the NZ bowlers with 2/28 in 9 overs, while Nathan McCullum and Guptill impressed in the field. The visitors win the series 2-0 with one ODI to go.",New Zealand won by 27 runs,ODI,South Africa vs New Zealand,3
"It was a see-saw battle all the way today. 261 wasn't an easy target but South Africa got a very good start. Smith led the chase with a century but wickets kept falling around him. South Africa looked safe until Smith was there but once he went, New Zealand pounced on the opportunity. However, a dramatic finish courtesy Ryan McLaren ensured that South Africa wouldn't 'choke' again.",South Africa won by 1 wkt,ODI,South Africa vs New Zealand,4
"Yet another India vs Pakistan thriller. What a roller-coaster ride in just a span of 20 overs. 134 wasn't too big a target but Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowled a stunning spell on debut to send panic waves through the Pakistan camp. Pakistan were 12/3 at one stage, but Pakistan's skipper Hafeez and the experienced Shoaib Malik calmed them down with some steady batting, before going on the attack towards the end. Things turned again towards the end as India got a couple of quick wickets, but Malik stayed calm and took them through.",Pakistan won by 5 wkts,T20,India vs Pakistan,3
A cracking game of cricket and India deservedly level the series 1-1. Pakistan started off well and were kept in the hunt by some exceptional batting from their skipper Hafeez but Dinda ensured that India didn't have to worry by taking care of three crucial wickets.,India won by 11 runs,T20,India vs Pakistan,4
Pakistan take a 1-0 lead in the series. Deservingly too. India did well to fight back from some tight situations. Dhoni did it with the lower order when they batted. Bhuvaneshwar Kumar led the way with the ball. They would lay some blame on a crucial umpiring error when Jamshed was adjudged not out on 24. Ashwin was guilty of overstepping and missed out on a wicket in the process. Yuvraj dropped Jamshed on 68. There was a flicker of hope for India when Ishant Sharma sent back Misbah-ul-Haq but Shoaib Malik steadied the ship. Jamshed went past his second ODI ton and helped Pakistan coast to a win.*,Pakistan won by 6 wkts,ODI,India vs Pakistan,4
"India's bowlers and fielders delivered the win. 168 wasn't a great score on this track but the fielders made it look like a score close to 200. There were a couple of missed chances - Dhoni dropped Misbah off Jadeja and Rahane dropped Hafeez off Ashwin, but those were rare blemishes on an otherwise great day on the field for India. Young Shami Ahmed and Bhuvneshwar Kumar set it up with a superb spell at the top, and the bowlers who followed just continued. Jadeja's 1/19 from 10 overs, Ishant's 3/36 and Ashwin's 2/47 say that it was a great teamwork from the bowlers.",India won by 10 runs,ODI,India vs Pakistan,5
The Man of the Match award went to Pujara but a lot of credit should go to Ojha as well. He was brilliant right through the game and ended up with 9 wickets in the match. India's pacers outshone their England counterparts as well. Umesh and Zaheer didn't get much out of the track but they troubled the batsmen with reverse swing. Spare a thought for Cook as well. He played a marathon knock but it wasn't enough to save the game.,India won by 9 wkts,Test,India vs England,4
"A straightforward win for the hosts despite missing many of their batting stars. A superb century from Hughes and outstanding batting efforts from Bailey and Hussey set them up for a huge score on the board. The bowlers then stood up, Tharanga and Mahela were dismissed cheaply, Dilshan and Chandimal steadied the ship before the calamitous run-out of Dilshan started the slide. Chandimal fought bravely for his 73 but got zero support at the other end.",Australia won by 107 runs,ODI,Australia vs Sri Lanka,2
It was a hard fought match but Sri Lanka came up well short. Philip Hughes' hundred proved to be a big difference in the end. Sri Lanka never had one batsman to hold an end up. Mahela Jayawardene promised much but fell too quickly. Mathews waged a lone battle for some time but it was not enough. Mahela will look back at his decision to bowl first too. It was definitely harder to bat as the game progressed. The Australian bowlers mixed it up very well. Xavier Doherty stood out and his 3 wickets broke the spine of the Sri Lankan batting.,Australia won by 32 runs,ODI,Australia vs Sri Lanka,2
"Pakistan have demolished South Africa here. The Proteas got off to a solid start as they raced to 50 in five overs. AB de Villers unfurled his Vil-Scoop and looked set to take the game away from Pakistan. Umar Gul came into the attack and he changed the complexion of the game. He took four wickets in seven balls as South Africa collapsed. The other bowlers, especially Mohammad Hafeez, ran through the tail and in the end, Pakistan have emerged victorious by a margin of 95 runs.",Pakistan won by 95 runs,T20,South Africa vs Pakistan,4
"A captain's knock from Misbah. He led the chase with his usual calmness and with a cool head. Hafeez gave them a decent start and Younis and Malik put together vital stands with Misbah. The match was set up by the bowlers though, and Pakistan will travel to the Wanderers on an even kneel. The South African bowlers toiled hard, but were let down by the batsmen as well as a wet ball.",Pakistan won by 6 wkts,ODI,South Africa vs Pakistan,2
"So a fantastic game of cricket comes to an end. Pakistan fought well throughout their innings but were just not good enough on the day, maybe a couple of more wickets in hand could have got them past the line. They got off to a good start with Mohammad Hafeez batting sensibly alongside Kamran Akmal before suddenly losing their way. Shahid Afridi raised hopes with a quickfire knock. Wahab Riaz batted really well but ran out of partners as Dale Steyn led the Proteas bowling line up with good support from the rest of the bowlers. Eventually they held their nerve to go 2-1 up in the 5-match series.",South Africa won by 34 runs,ODI,South Africa vs Pakistan,3
"The Durban jinx continues for the hosts. The bowlers fought hard but were let down by a below par score and their own profligacy with the extras. They had the visitors in trouble at 33/3 before a superb 153 run stand between Misbah and Farhat led Pakistan on the recovery path. Both batsmen missed out on their tons, Pakistan endured nervy times as usual before limping past the winning post.",Pakistan won by 3 wkts,ODI,South Africa vs Pakistan,3
"A complete hammering. West Indies just didn't turn up today. Only 33.1 overs were bowled today, which is less than a complete T20 game! This should completely demoralise the visitors. They were bowled out for just 70 in under 24 overs and Australia had no problems getting to the target. Glenn Maxwell had some fun in the middle and slogged his way to a half century, but the star of the day is undoubtedly Starc. His 5 for 20 completely blew away West Indies.",Australia won by 9 wkts,ODI,Australia vs Windies,2
"A convincing win in the end for Australia. Starc was the chief destroyer once again, picking up 5 wickets. He rocked the visitors early with 3 wickets. Powell resisted well with a wonderfully crafted 83, he was well supported by Dwayne Bravo who made an attractive 45. The duo added 126 runs for the 4th wicket but the visitors collapsed once Powell fell.",Australia won by 54 runs,ODI,Australia vs Windies,3
" 330 was a huge target but West Indies were in the game for a large part of the chase. The Bravos put on a century stand and set up a very good platform but the big hitters couldn't do much. Gayle failed, Pollard was run out, and that left a bit too much for the likes of Russell and Sammy. For Australia, it was Faulkner who was the pick of the bowlers. His double strike in the 38th over took the life out of the West Indies chase.",Australia won by 39 runs,ODI,Australia vs Windies,2
"A comfortable victory for Australia in the end. Their batsmen set it up led by the Man of the Match, Adam Voges. The chase was never going to be easy but West Indies began in earnest. Until the halfway point they were well and truly in the game. Johnson Charles' streaky 100 and Pollard's watchful innings gave them hope but neither could last till the end.",Australia won by 17 runs,ODI,Australia vs Windies,3
"Well with a mammoth score of over 200, the scoreboard pressure will always be telling on the side that is chasing. That was the case here as well as New Zealand, though for a brief moment looked like they were in the hunt, could never really build solid partnerships. Balls being skied to the fielder and credit to the England bowlers as well for banging the ball in and generating extra bounce. In the end skipper Stuart Broad led from the front with a four wicket haul and that pretty much sums up a fantastic day for England. ",England won by 40 runs,T20,New Zealand vs England,2
"New Zealand finish a superb win over the visitors after a blitzkreig by their skipper Brendon McCullum. England never looked in the game and struggled against the pace, bounce and swing of the pacers. Franklin came in at the end to sneak in a career best 4 wicket haul. If not for Buttler, England might not have even reached 100.",New Zealand won by 55 runs,T20,New Zealand vs England,2
"A convincing win for England after they lost the first match. They bowled well collectively, with Anderson leading the pack with a fifer. Chasing 270, they got off to a solid start with the skipper leading from the front with a solid half century. They lost the openers in the middle overs, but Trott and Root stitched a match winning partnership of 121 runs for the 3rd wicket. Root particularly impressed one and all with his range of shots and stayed unbeaten on 79 till the end.",England won by 8 wkts,ODI,New Zealand vs England,3
"England have dominated the whole match. After the bowlers put up a clinical performance, the batsmen played with a lot of maturity. Ian Bell started off well but fell in the pursuit of quick runs. Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott shared a steady 67 run stand before Tim Southee sent both Trott and Cook back. Eoin Morgan batted aggressively to get England closer to the target, before Joe Root scored the winning runs. For New Zealand, only Southee and Andrew Ellis bowled well but the rest of the bowling lacked penetration.",England won by 5 wkts,ODI,New Zealand vs England,2
"So the West Indies take a 1-0 lead in this 3-match series. Zimbabwe were never really in the hunt, their top-order was blown away very quickly and ever since then there was no recovery from them even though malcolm Waller registered his 4th ODI fifty. Sunil Narine bagged three wickets, while Dwayne Bravo and Andre Russell bagged two each.",West Indies won by 156 runs,ODI,Windies vs Zimbabwe,1
"A clinical performance from West Indies has helped them win the 3-match series 3-0. Chasing a below par total of 212, they got off to a cautious start, but lost Sarwan early. But Darren Bravo played the sheet anchor role and stayed unbeaten on 72 till the end to see them through. Powell gave him a good company, but was again out to a loose shot. Mutombodzi and Mushangwe bowled well for Zimbabwe, but they didn't have a good total to defend.",West Indies won by 5 wkts,ODI,Windies vs Zimbabwe,2
"Yet another comfortable win for the West Indies, Zimbabwe were never really in the hunt, wickets at regular intervals pegged them back big time as the hosts swept the series 2-0.",West Indies won by 41 runs,T20,Windies vs Zimbabwe,1
"After all the drama with the floodlights, the second innings started and it was going only Sri Lanka's way. Janith Perera and Tillakaratne Dilshan started off with a bang and were going over ten runs per over. But even as the former departed, Dilshan combined well with Kumar Sangakkara and went onto make his 12th ODI hundred. In the end Sri Lanka registered an emphatic 8-wicket win as they eclipsed the D/L target with 32 balls to spare.",Sri Lanka won by 8 wkts,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh,2
"What a match it turned out to be in the end after being interrupted by the rain and at one stage it looked like it will be called off. Chasing a revised target of 183, Bangladesh got off to a good start, but soon lost wickets in a heap. But Nasir held his nerve and stayed till the end to clinch a series levelling win for them. Sri Lanka fought hard, but the efforts of Malinga and Senanayake was not enough in the end to bring them back into the game.",Bangladesh won by 3 wkts,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh,3
"So Sri Lanka hold onto their No.1 ranking in T20Is for this year. In the end, Bangladesh did well to come close to the Sri Lankan total and this was also their highest total batting second in T20Is. 199 was always going to be a tough chase, but Ashraful started off well with some big hits. Soon they lost wickets in a heap and once again it was Rahim who brought them back to the game with a responsible knock. Some tight bowling towards the end by the Sri Lankan bowlers made it difficult for Bangladesh and they fell short by 17 runs.",Sri Lanka won by 17 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh,4
"A convincing win in the end for Bangladesh after they survived a top order failure to post a decent score. Bangladeshi seamers bowled a tight line and length to rip through the Zimbabwean top order, with only Taylor and Masakadza brothers offering some resistance. Ziaur Rahman was the wrecker-in-chief claiming his maiden 5-wicket haul to trigger the Zimbabwean collapse. But the credit must go to Nasir Hossain, who bailed Bangladesh out with a responsible knock after they were struggling at 94/4.",Bangladesh won by 121 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh,3
"An easy win for Zimbabwe in the end, sets up the decider on Wednesday. They bowled well to restrict Bangladesh for a decent total and also overcame a late onslasught by Razzak, who notched up a fastest fifty. They lost wickets initially, but Taylor and Williams' partnership got them back to the game, with Williams staying unbeaten till the end to help them level the series. Waller also supported him well and they romped home easily in the end winning by 6 wickets.",Zimbabwe won by 6 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh,2
"What a turnaround for Zimbabwe after they were beaten badly in the 1st ODI by 121 runs. Their batsmen clicked as a unit in both the ODIs they have won and that helped them take the 3-match series 2-1. They bowled well initially as they were boltered by the addition of Vitori. He gave them a good start and struck twice in 2 balls to leave Bangladesh struggling. Mahmudullah's late onslaught helped them to post 247. Zimbabwe started the chase in an aggressive fashion, but lost Masakadza and Taylor in quick succession. But Sibanda played a dream innings and also posted his 2nd ODI ton in the process to help Zimbabwe win the match quite easily. Williams also chipped in with a quick-fire fifty and ensured Zimbabwe didn't face any further hiccup. ",Zimbabwe won by 7 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh,3
"Brilliant win for Zimbabwe! Who would have thought they will win this one? At one stage, Bangladesh were cruising with Shakib and Shamshur on a rampage. But one over from Utseya changed it all and it all went downhill from there. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals, Mushfiqur had almost carried them home but he was caught off the first ball of the final over and it was all over for the visitors.",Zimbabwe won by 6 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh,5
"Fantastic win for Bangladesh! They batted well to reach a competitive score and then bowled brilliantly to confound the hosts. Zimbabwe kept losing wickets at regular intervals and never really looked in control of the game. Shakib bowled a remarkable spell, he picked up Taylor and Shingi and then cleaned up the tail as well. Spinners did the job for the visitors to reduce Zimbabwe to 9 wickets. In the end, a comprehensive win for Bangladesh as they square the T20 series 1-1.",Bangladesh won by 34 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh,2
"A comprehensive victory in the end. England never looked like they would chase this score down. Only Trott stood amongst the ruins and compiled a century, but the match was lost way before that. New Zealand were professional with the ball and took all their chances in the field. They have now got a 2-0 series lead and will look for a whitewash at Trent Bridge.",New Zealand won by 86 runs,ODI ,England vs New Zealand,2
"New Zealand would be thinking about their last five overs with the ball and the middle-order collapse with the bat. Guptill started off on a positive note, but the visitors suddenly lost track of their chase. England did really well to put pressure on the New Zealand batsmen with some fine bowling. In the end, it was too much for Taylor as he ran out of partners. ",England won by 34 runs,ODI,England vs New Zealand,2
"What a game of cricket we've had tonight. England were right in the chase from the word go. Openers Lumb and Hales got them off to a blazing start. Luke Wright continued the good work and got to his fifty. But the visitors chipped in at regular intervals to keep a check on the run flow. It was down to 35 from the last 3 overs thanks to a cameo from Bopara. But he was left stranded at the other end as Nathan McCullum, Ian Butler and Corey Anderson did the job for the Kiwis in the final overs and helped their side take an unassailable 1-0 lead in the 2-match T20I series.",New Zealand won by 5 runs,T20,England vs New Zealand,5
"What an amazing match this turned out to be in the end. There were lots of stoppages due to rain in the 1st innings and the match was reduced to 47 overs. Despite a tough D/L adjusted target, Ireland fought well, thanks to a superb century from Stirling and some amazing hitting by Kevin O'Brien helped them come closer to the Pak total and they just prevailed in the end by 1 run. Pakistani bowling was horrible and even their experienced spinner, Ajmal went for 71 runs in his 10 overs.",Match tied (D/L method),ODI,Ireland vs Pakistan,5
"Chris Gayle has once again stolen the show at his home ground with a power-packed display. His 115 run stand with Johnson Charles laid the foundation for their win. Gayle notched up his 21st ODI century and his first against Sri Lanka. Although the Lankans came back with a couple of quick wickets, West Indies were firmly in the driver's seat and they managed to seal victory with a bonus point as they chased the target down in less than 40 overs.",West Indies won by 6 wkts,ODI,Windies vs Sri Lanka,5
"Kudos to West Indies. They did a great job of restricting the strong Indian batting line-up to an average score. Later, thanks to Charles, their innings went through smoothly before a few brain fades made the match interesting. The birthday boy Kemar Roach kept his cool and played calmly to escort his side to safety. India will not exactly be displeased with this act. Despite the absence of their skipper MS Dhoni, they battled hard, led by the aggressive Virat Kohli who rotated his bowlers and fielders admirably.",West Indies won by 1 wkt,ODI,Windies vs India,4
"India showed no intent whatsoever in this chase. By the end of 10 overs, India were crawling around at a run-rate just under three. They kept on losing wickets and only Ravindra Jadeja showed some character with an unbeaten 49. Herath and Senanayake chipped in with wickets at crucial intervals as Sri Lanka rounded off the perfect day in style. ",Sri Lanka won by 161 runs,ODI,India vs Sri Lanka,1
"Kohli has registered his first win as skipper. West Indies were already on the back foot when the rain delay shelved some overs off. Chasing 274 for an unlikely win and 219 to deny India the bonus point, Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma ripped through the middle order. Roach and Narine delayed the inevitable with a 58 run stand but Jadeja took the remaining wickets to seal a massive 102 run victory. India's victory has given them the bonus point and the tournament is now wide open.",India won by 102 runs (D/L Method),ODI,Windies vs India,2
"West Indies started off very slowly as Eranga and Mathews bowled with discipline. However, a 123 run stand between Simmons and Darren Bravo gave West Indies some hope with both batsmen notching up gritty half centuries. However, with their departures, West Indies fell behind but they ensured Sri Lanka did not concede the bonus point. Mathews was the star for Sri Lanka with 4/29 as his team performed admirably.",Sri Lanka won by 39 runs (D/L method),ODI,Windies vs Sri Lanka,2
"India were coasting at 139/3 with Rohit Sharma batting well. However, once he departed, India struggled to gain momentum. Herath was the chief destroyer and he snapped up Ravindra Jadeja and Ashwin in quick succession in his final over. However, Dhoni hung in there as wickets tumbled at the other end. In the last over bowled by Eranga, Dhoni was in his elements as he smashed a six, a four and then a six as India clinched a thriller by one wicket. This has been a memorable final and India's golden run in ODIs continues.",India won by 1 wkt,ODI,India vs Sri Lanka,5
"In the end, it was an easy victory for Scotland as they successfully defended a low total. Their bowlers struck in regular intervals and the Kenyan batsmen also fell to some poor shots. Goudie chipped in with three wickets while Drummond and MacLeod picked up two wickets each. Scotland lead the 2-match series 1-0. ",Scotland won by 35 runs,T20,Scotland vs Kenya,1
"Well, it was a one-man show all throughout the game. Shahid Afridi, on his comeback, first bailed the side out of trouble with the bat, and with the ball, he was near unplayable accounting for 7 wickets. If one thought Pakistan batted very badly, the West Indies reply was even poor. None of the batsmen got going and eventually they succumbed to pressure. Afridi now has the second best bowling figures in an ODI. Pakistan go 1-0 up in the 5-match series.",Pakistan won by 126 runs,ODI ,Windies vs Pakistan,2
"So West Indies have managed to square the series here with 3 games to go. This looks like a bat first pitch. Pakistan were victorious in the first game. West Indies made a decent score today and more importantly, they bowled really well upfront. Pakistan were never really allowed to be free. Nasir Jamshed was given 4 lives but he could not make the most of it. Umar Akmal was the only other successful batsman for the visitors. Narine was the pick of the bowlers and he strangled them with 4 wickets. In the end, West Indies have managed a comprehensive win.",West Indies won by 37 runs,ODI,Windies vs Pakistan,1
"Phew! What a game of cricket. It had everything in it. The game was boring when Samuels and Bravo could never really get going and after a flurry of wickets it got interesting. One thought Pakistan pulled off a fine win but they were denied by Holder and more importantly, Umar Akmal himself. West Indies would have backed themselves to chase down 230 on a decent batting strip. They lost Gayle, Charles and Darren Bravo early. Simmons and Samuels steadied the ship before both were dismissed. Pressure got the better of Dwayne Bravo, Pollard and Sammy who went in quick succession. It was down to 15 runs needed off the last over. Holder held his nerve and hit a boundary and then a stunning six before Akmal grabbed attention on the final ball by missing a relatively easy run-out.",Match tied,ODI,Windies vs Pakistan,5
"The rain has brought in some luck with it for Pakistan. They were not doing that great before the rain break at 17 overs, but once play restarted they were outstanding. Pakistan needed 121 in 14 overs. With 8 wickets in hand, one would back the batting side. Hafeez and Misbah scored fifties to keep the run rate in check. In the end, Umar Akmal finished the game off with 6 balls remaining hitting a flurry of boundaries in the penultimate over. ",Pakistan won by 6 wkts (D/L Method),ODI,Windies vs Pakistan,3
"Pakistan kept a healthy scoring rate but lost wickets at regular intervals. However, Umar Amin stepped up and scored runs at will. His 47 laid the base for Pakistan's march towards victory. Shahid Afridi also played a vital knock but he lost his wicket at a crucial time. Zulfiqar Babar struck a four and a six in the last over to seal a thrilling two wicket win for Pakistan. Gabriel's erratic bowling in the 19th over has proven to be very costly for the West Indies.",Pakistan won by 2 wkts,T20,Windies vs Pakistan,5
"Fantastic win for the hosts! This is South Africa's second biggest defeat in ODIs by runs. The Lankans were brilliant as the visitors never really got going from the start. Malinga cleaned up Ingram on the very first ball after which, Petersen, Duminy and de Villiers chipped in a few runs and it looked like the visitors were fighting back. But some clever bowling by the spinners out-foxed them and they began losing wickets at regular intervals. Sri Lanka lead the 5-match series 1-0. ",Sri Lanka won by 180 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,3
"The injury to Hashim Amla already jolted South Africa's batting line-up. Peterson fell in the first over bowled by Malinga before Petersen and Duminy strung a solid stand. However, the Sri Lankan bowlers bowled with discipline and never allowed the Proteas to get away. In the end, rain had the final say and Sri Lanka won the match by 17 runs (D/L method) to go 2-0 up in the series.",Sri Lanka won by 17 runs (D/L method),ODI ,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,2
"South Africa finally taste victory in Lankan soil against the hosts since September 2nd, 1993. The bowlers made sure that Sri Lanka struggled in the chase, Tsotsobe struck thrice in no time to reduce them to 16/3. Mahela and Chandimal added useful runs but when they were reduced to 92/6, it looked all but over. Thisara had other ideas as he smashed 35 runs from one Peterson over, but the visitors held their nerve to close out the game.",South Africa won by 56 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,3
A dominant partnership between Dilshan and Sangakkara ensured that SL won the match with a huge degree of comfort. Dilshan scored his 17th ODI hundred while Sangakkara chipped in with 91. The duo added 184 runs for the 2nd wicket and all but sealed the victory for the hosts. South Africa did not go for a review when Duminy trapped Sangakkara plumb in front very early in the piece and they paid a heavy price for it. Sri Lanka go 3-1 ahead and deservingly so.,Sri Lanka won by 8 wkts,ODI,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,3
"A comfortable win for Sri Lanka in the end. With the series lost, they came out firing and put the South African players under huge pressure. Dilshan led from the front and it was apt that he finished things off. Mahela was the ideal foil for him, but SA clawed back in the middle overs only for Thisara to ease the hosts past the winning post. ",Sri Lanka won by 6 wkts,T20,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,2
"A comprehensive victory for the Indians. The openers got starts but failed to build on. Virat Kohli scored his 2nd ton as captain in just 4 matches and was well supported by debutant Ambati Rayudu as the visitors chipped away at the target. Kohli and Rayudu helped himself to a half century to seal India's dominance. Kohli and Raina fell towards the end, but the match was all but decided by then. India go 1-0 ahead and continue their winning streak.",India won by 6 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs India,3
"Yet another comprehensive performance from India. Shikhar Dhawan set the tone with a fine albeit chancy century. In the reply, Zimbabwe got off to a solid start. Vusi Sibanda and Hamilton Masakadza started confidently but once these two fell the innings just fell apart. Zimbabwe were then just trying to play out the 50 overs. They managed to do that. For India, Unadkat had a very good day. He picked up 4 wickets and ran out Taylor as well. ",India won by 58 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs India,3
Virat Kohli led from the front yet again and helped India to their 3rd straight win of the tournament. This win was set up by the bowlers. Zimbabwe lost wickets at regular intervals and never got going. The target of 184 was never going to be enough to trouble India. The start was solid and Kohli stayed through till the end to guide his team to a comfortable win.,India won by 7 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs India,2
"Easy win in the end for the Indians. The result was never in doubt once they bowled Zimbabwe out for 144. Cheteshwar Pujara failed to make the most of his opportunity at the top of the order as he was bowled by Chatara for just 13. Rohit Sharma scratched around but made sure that he did not throw his wicket away. Raina, promoted to No. 3 made the most of the chance as the duo scripted an impressive partnership. India now go 4-0 up and will look to complete the whitewash when the two teams meet on Saturday.",India won by 9 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs India,2
"Another routine win for India and they take the series 5-0. After a fine start given by Dhawan, Jadeja slowed things for a while before accelerating alongside Rahane. In the end, Jadeja batted through and ensured a comfortable win for his side. Zimbabwe will be really unhappy with their show in the series.",India won by 7 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs India,2
"An easy win for Pakistan in the end. The hosts started off well with Masakadza and Sibanda puttting up a 53-run opening stand. But, Anwar Ali trapped Masakadza in the 8th over and it all went downhill from there. The spinners were exceptional and quick strikes pegged back Zimbabwe as their scoring rate decreased. Taylor's fightback at one end was not enought as they needed 32 off the final over. Tanvir made sure he bowled a disciplined line to give the visitors a comfortable 25-run victory in the first match.",Pakistan won by 25 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,2
"Clinical performance by the visitors as they clinch the two match T20I series. After putting up a competitive total on the board, they were brilliant with the ball as well. The hosts started off well but stumbled in the middle overs as the Pakistani spinners stole the day. Hafeez, in particular, was fantastic as he picked up 3 important wickets. This is the 13th bilateral T20 series win for Pakistan, the most by any team.",Pakistan won by 19 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,3
"What a clinical performance from Zimbabwe. They end the 15 year winless drought against Pakistan. Last time they won a match against Pakistan in ODIs was way back in 1998. Chasing a decent total, they got off to a solid start and the opening pair put on 107. Masakadza gave them a fantastic start and was unlucky to miss out on a century as he got out for 85. Taylor found some form at a crucial time and Williams played a blinder at the end to see them through without much fuss.",Zimbabwe won by 7 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,3
A late collapse hurt the Zimbabweans. They looked good to take the fight to the Pakistan camp when Taylor and Waller were batting together. Taylor was dismissed by Ajmal and Waller was castled by Junaid. The tail fell apart and the visitors completed a crushing victory. Junaid was the best bowler on view and he deserved all the accolades.,Pakistan won by 90 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,22
"A clinical performance from Pakistan and they take the series 2-1. They had not won a series for the past 10 years which was levelled at 1-1 or 2-2, but they have broken that. They were put into bat and they struggled hard to reach a decent total. In the end Misbah bailed them out with a fighting fifty. Zimbabwe started their chase pretty well, but lost back to back wickets of Masakadza and Taylor in quick sucession, which dented their hopes. Almost all Pakistani bowlers chipped in with wickets and Zimbabwe never really looked like chasing down the total.",Pakistan won by 108 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,3
"A comprehensive win in the end for Australia. After being put into bat, Finch gave them a dream start and whatever he connected went out of the park and he ended up hitting the highest ever individual score in T20Is. Chasing 249 was always a tough ask, but England started the chase on a perfect note, but lost 3 wickets in space of 2 overs which derailed their chase. Root once again played a wondeful innings despite getting hit on the grill. In the end the Australian bowling proved to be the game changer as they used the yorkers frequently. Bopara also played a fine hand, but the pressure got to him eventually.",Australia won by 39 runs,T20,England vs Australia,4
"Comprehensive victory in the end for England. It was a tough chase for the visitors, they lost Finch and Watson early. Warner led the chase with a spirited half century, but it all went downhill once he was dismissed. Maxwell did his best towards the end, but it was always a steep chase. Dernbach was the best England bowler and he ended up with three wickets.",England won by 27 runs,T20,England vs Australia,4
A comprehensive win for Australia in the end. Chasing 362 was always a tough ask. Australian bowlers struck at regular intervals to make matter even worse for Scotland. Johnson was the pick of the bowlers taking 4 for 36.,Australia won by 200 runs,ODI,Scotland vs Australia,3
"A clinical performance from Australia has helped them win this one quite easily. This is also their first win in an ODI against England since 2011. Put into bat, they posted a huge total on the board, thanks to Clarke's first ODI ton against England. Their bowlers then responded well with some accurate bowling. Mitch Johnson was at his best today and consistently bowled at over 93 MPH to trouble the English batsmen. Only Pietersen, Morgan and Buttler excelled with the bat, with rest of the batsmen falling to some poor strokes.",Australia won by 88 runs,ODI,England vs Australia,4
"A fantastic knock from Jos Buttler has helped England level the series 1-1. England were left floundering at the start when Clint McKay's hat-trick left the hosts at 8/3. It was tough going for Morgan and Carberry as they looked to rebuild the innings. However, after they got their eye in, they played some wonderful strokes and registered gritty fifties. The 104-run stand was broken by Watson who accounted for Morgan. However, some positive strokeplay from Buttler and some help from Stokes ensured England won this match by three wickets to remain unbeaten at Swalec. For Australia, this is their fourth loss in five ODIs at this venue.",England won by 3 wkts,ODI,England vs Australia,4
Australia have some silverware to take home at the end of their long English summer. The England batsman never really got going and lost early wickets. They were in the hunt until Bopara and Buttler shared a fine partnership but the batting powerplay helped Australia as both were dismissed in quick succession. The tail wagged for a while but they had too much to do and eventually were bowled out 49 runs short. Faulkner bagged three wickets while Johnson was again outstanding with the ball and picked up two wickets.,Australia won by 49 runs,ODI,England vs Australia,3
"This is an emphatic win for Bangaldesh. They were chasing a stiff total and did well to get there with 4 balls to spare. The openers gave them a good start as they added 61 and laid the platform. Shamsur was excellent and missed out on a well deserved hundred. He was well supported by Naeem Islam. In the end the cameo from Nasir Hossain took them home. The New Zealand bowlers were finding it difficult to get regular wickets, they could not get an early wicket and were under pressure most of the time during the run chase. The jinx continues for New Zealand, they have now been whitewashed twice in three years.",Bangladesh won by 4 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs New Zealand,3
"Bangladesh's poor record in T20Is continues as they slump to their 7th loss in 8 games. Skipper Rahim kept them in the hunt after a flurry of wickets at the start. He was well supported by Naeem and Nasir but pressure got the better of them as they lost wickets at regular intervals. Mahmudullah and Gazi shared a fantastic 57-run stand for the 7th wicket and threatened to take the game away from New Zealand. But in the end, the vistors held their nerve and now they will not be going home empty handed.",New Zealand won by 15 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs New Zealand,3
"What a story Yuvraj has written for himself. This was his comeback match and he is back with a bang. India were set a challenging target and they lost Rohit early. Raina and Dhawan gave them a good start in the powerplay until both were dismissed. Kohli threw his wicket away after getting a start. But it was the Yuvraj and Dhoni partnership of 102 that took India home. The former was the aggressor as he paced his innings superbly and scored his highest T20I score, he was well aided by his skipper who played second fiddle.",India won by 6 wkts,T20,India vs Australia,4
"A comfortable win in the end for Australia. India were off to a bad start losing Dhawan very early. Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina, all started well but failed to convert it into bigger knocks. Dhoni failed for once and the lower order capitulated in the face of the mounting run-rate. Johnson was fiery in every spell and was probably the best bowler for the visitors. He was helped along very well by the rest of the bowlers as Australia take a 1-0 lead in the 7-match series.",Australia won by 72 runs,ODI,India vs Australia,2
"Excellent run chase and once again the top three batsmen set it up for the Indians. Dhawan started well, he was once again lucky tonight, dropped twice on 19 and 56, as he scored his 4th ODI hundred. He was well supported by Rohit Sharma as the pair added 178 runs for the 1st wicket. Rohit missed out on his ton, dismissed by a rank half-tracker from Finch. The stage was set for Virat Kohli. He continued with the form he showed in Jaipur as the target came down with every over, Dhawan was dismissed shortly after his hundred and India suffered a minor hiccup when the two out of form batsmen, Yuvraj Singh and Raina were dismissed in a Johnson over.*",India won by 6 wkts,ODI,India vs Australia,3
It is a comprehensive victory for Pakistan. South Africa never really got going. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals and none of the batsmen really got in. They struggled to get the spinners away. All the three spinners created all sorts of problems. Some of the batsmen got starts but no one went on to get a big one. The Pakistan bowling once again came to the rescue after their poor batting. Tanvir got the early wicket and the spinners came in and took control of the game. They were economical and took 6 wickets between them.,Pakistan won by 66 runs,ODI,Pakistan vs South Africa,2
"It has been a disciplined effort from South Africa to go 2-1 up in the series. The openers were looking good and added 50 runs for the first wicket. But it was that man again, Steyn, who came into the attack and got rid off the danger man Shehzad. They kept on getting wickets at regular intervals and once again Pakistani batsmen struggled to play Tahir, who ended up with career best figures in ODIs. There is lot to think about for Pakistan as their batsmen let them down again. Most of them got starts, but threw their wickets away. The partnership between Riaz and Tanvir looked promising but it was too late.",South Africa won by 68 runs,ODI,Pakistan vs South Africa,2
"Once again Pakistan have handed the match on a platter to South Africa from a winning position. South Africa now take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the 5-match series. Pakistan made two good changes to their side and that yielded good results for them, with both Maqsood and Junaid performing well. Maqsood looked promising and smashed his maiden fifty to bail Pakistan out of trouble. He even stitched an fruitful stand with Misbah, but his wicket triggered the collapse and Pakistan lost 5 wickets for 10 runs soon after. Umar Akmal played a fine cameo, but got out to a poor shot. Once again Misbah hung around, but the pressure got the better of him and he holed out in the deep. The visitors held their nerve at the death to pull off a fine win.",South Africa won by 28 runs,ODI,Pakistan vs South Africa,4
It is a comprehensive victory for South Africa. They never looked in trouble after they were set a mere 99 as the target. They lost Amla early but de Kock and du Plessis saw them through with no more hiccups. Both of them batted sensibly as they attacked all the other bowles except Ajmal. They paced their innings perfectly as they went after the bowling only after they were well set. ,South Africa won by 9 wkts,T20,Pakistan vs South Africa,1
"Yet another convincing performance from the Indians and once again it was the top order who set them up for this chase. Rohit Sharma looked a bit iffy at the start, but then settled down to play some fine shots. He lost Dhawan early, but Kohli was once again in his elements. They made batting look easy on what was a difficult surface. Both made fifties, with Kohli also completing 5000 career ODI runs, becoming the fastest Indian and the joint fastest along with Sir Viv Richards.*",India won by 6 wkts,ODI,India vs Windies,4
"West Indies pull off the victory and level the series 1-1. They got off to a poor start when they lost Charles and Samuels early. But Darren Bravo and Powell steadied the innings and added 100 runs for the third wicket. Both got to their fifties before throwing it away. Simmons was joined by Sammy with whom he added 82 runs for the sixth wicket. Simmons had a reprieve on 43, when Yuvraj dropped a simple catch. He then went on to score a fifty and became one of the four batsmen to do so. But it was their Test skipper, who kept his cool and took them home.",West Indies won by 2 wkts,ODI,India vs Windies,4
"This was a professional performance by the Indian batsmen. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli fell cheaply but Dhawan was in sublime form. Yuvraj Singh was an able foil, he wasn't at his best, struggling notably against Narine, but managed to fight along. The pair all but took the match out of the visitor's hands. Dhawan completed his 5th ODI hundred, Yuvraj went past fifty after a long time. Raina played a sweet little cameo while Dhoni was there to play the winning shot. For West Indies, Ravi Rampaul and Sunil Narine were exceptional with the ball, but they got no support from the rest of the bowling attack. *",India won by 5 wkts,ODI,India vs Windies,4
"A clinical win in the end for Sri Lanka and they win the rain-curtailed 2-match series 1-0. Chasing a moderate total of 143, they got off to a scintillating start with Kusal Perera firing on all cylinders. Dilshan gave him good support and allowed the youngster to call the shots. Both batsmen completed their fifties and it was Dilshan's 6th consecutive 50+ score in the T20 format. New Zealand's fielding let them down badly as they dropped Kusal twice and the ground fielding also was not up to the mark. ",Sri Lanka won by 8 wkts,T20,Sri Lanka vs New Zealand,3
It has started to rain again and the match has been called off. South Africa win by 4 runs according to D/L method. The match was poised evenly when the rain Gods interrupted. The visitors had got off to a decent start and were within par with the required run-rate. Shehzad was the first to go when he chopped a ball onto the stumps from Tsotsobe. Hafeez and Jamshed did well to stitch a partnership before the latter got out. Soon the rain intervened and they were one hit away from winning.,South Africa won by 4 runs (D/L method),T20,South Africa vs Pakistan,2
It was an all-round effort from Pakistan that helps them square the 2-match series 1-1. South Africa were once again given a good start from de Kock and Amla. The latter continued after the departure of his partner and was out just before he could get his maiden T20I fifty. Duminy played well with Miller and they put on 53 for the fifth wicket. But they were left with too many to get and some good death bowling did not help their cause as well. Afridi was the pick of the bowlers as he picked up three wickets and was well supported by Bhatti. Tanvir held his nerve to defend 17 runs in the last over and that helped Pakistan level the series.,Pakistan won by 6 runs,T20,South Africa vs Pakistan,4
"What a thriller we have witnessed just now. This is Pakistan's maiden ODI series win in South Africa. Only these two teams could have snatched defeat from the hands of victory and South Africa continue to live up to their 'Chokers' tag. Chasing a competitive total of 262, they went off to a poor start losing Smith, but Amla and de Kock steadied the ship with an 87-run partnership for the 2nd wicket. The arrival of ABD saw South Africa shift gears. The South African captain went berserk and smashed all the Pakistani bowlers all round the park. His dismissal slowed things down and pressure got to them and eventually they lost by a narrow margin.",Pakistan won by 1 run,ODI,South Africa vs Pakistan,5
"South Africa had a few hiccups but got there in the end. They got off to a flier with de Kock and Amla going all guns blazing. de Kock threw his wicket away, the spinners came in and took control of the game and didn't give any freebies. However, de Villiers was positive as kept his cool and saw his team through which he could not in the last game. Ajmal was once again the pick of the bowlers and was well supported by Rehman but they did not have enough runs on the board.",South Africa won by 4 wkts,ODI,South Africa vs Pakistan,4
"West Indies at last win a match on the tour. They huffed and puffed before getting through. McClenaghan got the hosts off to a fabulous start as he picked up four three wickets and had them reeling at 3 for 32. Dwayne Bravo and Simmons steadied the innings before the skipper was snapped up. Simmons was looking good before he poked at a wide one from Mills. But, it was Sammy who played a blinder of an innings to take them to victory. The knock of 43 came off 27 balls and he picked the right balls to attack. The Kiwi bowlers were led by McClenaghan, who picked up his first five wicket haul and continued his fine form this year. He was well supported by Mills who picked up two wickets and kept it tight at the other end.",West Indies won by 2 wkts,ODI,New Zealand vs Windies,4
"Things never really got going for the New Zealand batsmen. They all got to good starts but were unable to hold on and convert those starts into big scores. The West Indies bowlers were impeccable with their line and lengths and hit the right areas. Nikita Miller was the star with the ball as he finished with impressive figures of 4-45.West Indies have leveled the five-match ODI series 2-2. They have thrashed the hosts by 203 runs, the highest victory margin in terms of runs for West Indies against any Test playing nation. West Indies were fantastic with the bat, thanks to the solid 211-run stand between Edwards and Bravo. They continued their good show with the ball as well and picked up wickets at regular intervals.",West Indies won by 203 runs,ODI,New Zealand vs Windies,4
The West Indies bowlers were not supported by their fielders. They put down four chances at the start and were sloppy throughout. Narine was once again the pick of the bowlers and was well supported by Russell. The others were not effective and went for plenty of runs.New Zealand clinch the T20I series 2-0. They started off well with Ryder going berserk but West Indies came back well to leave the hosts reeling at 5 for 79. Ronchi joined Taylor out in the middle and the duo added 68 runs for the sixth wicket. The wicket-keeper carried his fine form from the previous game to notch up his maiden T20I fifty. Taylor played the perfect second fiddle in the partnership. Neesham came down and finished things off in a hurry.,New Zealand won by 4 wkts,T20,New Zealand vs Windies,3
"An abject surrender from India. This is South Africa's second biggest victory over India in terms of runs. The last sentence sums up the night India just had. Chasing a mammoth 359 runs for victory, India got off to a tough start as they were tested by some top class fast bowling from Steyn and Morkel, with the former unlucky on numerous occasions as he went past the outside edge on a consistent basis. Kohli showed some resistance and struck some meaty boundaries, but McLaren worked him over with a peach of a delivery. Dhoni waged a lone battle and he didn't get the support from the other end. All South African seamers were amongst the wickets and India have to sort the short ball issue pretty soon as they were bounced out consistently. ",South Africa won by 141 runs,ODI,South Africa vs India,3
An excellent bowling performance hands South Africa a series victory. India got off to a horrendous start as they lost Dhawan and Kohli for a duck. Rohit and Rahane didn't last long either as they went playing some poor shots. Dhoni and Raina hung around and added 40 runs for the fifth wicket before the latter was sent packing by Philander. It was just a matter of time till the end was near. Jadeja and Ashwin prolonged the inevitable for a while before succumbing to the pace and bounce of the Proteas bowlers. The South African bowling was at its best as all the bowlers were among the wickets but Tsotsobe and Steyn were at their lethal best as they shared 7 wickets between them.,South Africa won by 134 runs,ODI,South Africa vs India,3
"An excellent comeback from Sri Lanka has helped them to retain their No.1 ranking in T20Is. After being put in by Hafeez, they went off to a cracking start and the partnership between Perera and Sanga changed the course of the game and they ended up posting a mammoth total. Chasing a huge score, Pakistan got off to a poor start losing Shehzad early and rest of the batsmen failed to stitch an useful stand and at one stage they were precariously placed at 121/8, but a fighting stand of 63 for the 9th wicket between Tanvir and Ajmal brought some hope for the home team, but Sri Lanka fought back to snare the remaining 2 wickets.",Sri Lanka won by 24 runs,T20,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,4
"So, Pakistan go 1-0 up in this 5-match ODI series with a thrilling win. One thought they had the game in their bag when Thisara Perera was dismissed in the 42nd over with Sri Lanka needing over 100 runs, but a stunning 87-run partnership between Senanayake and Prasanna spiced up things. It looked like the duo were going to pull off an unlikely win with a record 8th wicket stand for Sri Lanka against Pakistan but they couldn't quite hold their nerves in the end.",Pakistan won by 11 runs,ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,4
"Phew! An exciting game of cricket in the end as I promised at the start. Angelo Mathews has justified his decision to bowl first and Sri Lanka will be very happy with their effort today. They started the chase well before both the openers perished run-out. Sangakkara and Chandimal steadied the ship with a 94-run 3rd wicket partnership but Junaid triggered a mini collapse as he knocked over three Sri Lankan batsmen. Kulasekara raised the tempo while Mathews was just playing second fiddle to him. The duo shared a 57-run stand before Sri Lanka panicked again but in the end, they held their nerve to clinch a thrilling win. So that helps the visitors level the 5-match series 1-1 with 3 games to go. Misbah-ul-Haq wasn't happy with his side's effort as they let Sri Lanka off the hook from a winning position.",Sri Lanka won by 2 wkts,ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,5
"A comprehensive victory in the end for Pakistan. Sri Lanka were never in the chase, Gul struck twice in his 2nd over, a lot depended on Dilshan and Sangakkara, but the latter was dismissed cheaply. The rest caved in cheaply, despite a fighting fifty from Dilshan. Gul took 3 wickets, Hafeez capped a fine day with two while there were 2 each for Ajmal and Junaid. Pakistan lead the series by a 2-1 margin.",Pakistan won by 113 runs,ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,2
"An all-round display by Pakistan has helped them seal the series in the 4th ODI itself. They bowled in unison to restrict Sri Lanka under 250 and came out in an aggressive manner in the chase. Once again they lost Sharjeel early, but it was Hafeez all the way like it has been in this series so far. He notched up his 3rd ton of the series and had two important stands with Shehzad and Maqsood. He remained unbeaten till the end to see his team through to a series clinching victory. Sri Lankan bowlers were not effective and they have lot to ponder as their batting and bowling has not clicked in this series so far. ",Pakistan won by 8 wkts,ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,3
"Sri Lanka somehow managed to pull off the victory. They started off brilliantly, as Perera and Dilshan got them going with a rapid 75 runs. The latter was superb in his knock of 47, he took on all the bowlers and carted them around, he perished playing one shot too many. Dilshan and Sanga steadied the innings, before both of them went in succession. Mathews struggled to get the ball of the square, but it was the Chandimal and Mendis partnership of 40 runs that saw them through. Chandimal was mature in his innings as he took his time to settle down before playing his shots and Mendis with some big blows at the end tilted the match in favour of the visitors.",Sri Lanka won by 2 wkts,ODI ,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,4
"Phew! What a game of cricket we've had. At 120/5, Australia were down and out and hopes of England's first win on the tour were very high. Glenn Maxwell and Brad Haddin batted sensibly to add 80 runs for the 6th wicket after Shaun Marsh's fine fifty. Nathan Coulter-Nile played a good hand alongside James Faulkner after Tim Bresnan removed both Haddin and Maxwell in the same over to put the visitors on top. Faulkner was very calm at the start. Maybe he knew he could hit sixes at will after his heroics at Mohali and in the end he was proved right. The England bowlers couldn't defend 25 runs off the last 2 overs. Stokes offered some very generous length balls to help Faulkner muscle them. Bresnan didn't do a fine job in the final over either and in the end, Australia have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.",Australia won by 1 wkt,ODI,Australia vs England,5
"It's been another clinical performance from the Aussies. England actually started the game off very well with skipper Cook batting aggressively. But when Clarke took some pace off the ball by introducing the spinners, the visitors started to lose their way. England recovered for a while in the form of Morgan and Bopara but with the Aussies getting 4 wickets for 21 runs at one stage, England were reduced to 198/8. Bresnan pushed the score past 240 with some lusty blows and gave something for the bowlers to work with.",Australia won by 7 wkts,ODI,Australia vs England,3
"With this win, Australia have ensured that England will go home empty-handed. 130 was never going to be enough on this wicket, especially against this Australian side. The bowlers did the job for the hosts initially with Hazlewood bagging 4 wickets. In reply, White started off in grand style hitting boundaries at will. Finch fell in the 6th over just before the opening stand crossed fifty. Maxwell didn't last long either as he hit one in the deep to Bresnan. But from there on, captain Bailey joined White and the duo completed their respective fifties to help Australia take a 2-0 lead in the 3-match T20I series.",Australia won by 8 wkts,T20,Australia vs England,3
"England had a daunting task and with a change in the batting-order, the openers found the going tough and perished in quick succession. A very disciplined effort from Australia meant that the batsmen had to work really hard for their runs. They also managed to pick up wickets at regular intervals and kept the run flow under check. In the end, with two wickets apiece for Coulter-Nile, Maxwell and Muirhead, Bailey's boys won the final T20I by 84 runs to make it 3-0.",Australia won by 84 runs,T20,Australia vs England,2
"An emphatic victory for the home side, they were never really in trouble as the openers gave them a flying start. India came back with a couple of quick wickets, but that brought Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson to the crease, who played sensible cricket to negate the danger posed by the spin threat of Jadeja and Ashwin. They rotated the strike and concentrated on not giving their wickets away to the spin duo. That stand set the platform and the job was duly completed by Taylor and McCullum.",New Zealand won by 7 wkts,ODI,New Zealand vs India,2
"Bangladesh were in the game until the last delivery. They got off to a flier as Tamim and Shamsur went berserk, adding 52 runs for the first wicket. Anamul continued the good start given by the openers and was ably supported by Shakib and Nasir. He went on to notch up his maiden T20I fifty and almost pulled off a thriller for his team. With 17 runs required in the last over he brought it down to 3 off the last ball. But, he could not put the full toss away which sealed the victory for Sri Lanka.",Sri Lanka won by 2 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka,5
"South Africa regained control after a poor first over from Tsotsobe with the wicket of Finch in the second over. Watson didn't last long either but Warner batted very well to smash the bowlers all over the park. A double-strike from Duminy brought South Africa back in the game again. With 28 needed off the last 2 overs, Hodge held his nerve and hit some lusty blows in the final over to take Australia home with 2 balls to spare.",Aus won by 5 wkts,T20,South Africa vs Australia,4
"A serious blow to West Indies, the World Champions. Ireland did well to restrict them to a poor total on a surface that was difficult to bat on. In reply, though getting off to a poor start, Ed Joyce dropped anchor and batted sensibly alongside Poynter. The latter fell after sharing a 50-run stand but Ed Joyce batted through and took his side home in the last over with the company of Kevin O'Brien. So this win means, Ireland take an unassailable 1-0 lead in the 2-match T20I series.",Ireland won by 6 wkts,T20,Windies vs Ireland,3
"Well Pakistan win the match with a bonus point, who would have thought about this when they were struggling at 117/6. The Afghans were on top for the first part of the game, but Umar Akmal's knock took the match away from them. While chasing, their top-order played too defensively and that put the pressure on the other batsmen. Ajmal was as-usual wily with his variations and none of the Afghan batsmen could read the doosra. Afridi bowled a mean spell and Hafeez bowled a tight line and also ended up taking 3 wickets.",Pakistan won by 72 runs,ODI,Afghanistan vs Pakistan,3
"A superb match has ended and Sri Lanka have beaten the second Asian gaints in another cliff-hanger. The top-three set up the run chase, and although the Indian middle order pulled things back, Sangakkara ensured the victory for the Sri Lankans. Thirimanne and Kusal Perera were solid at the start while Sangakkara made his 18th ODI hundred. Jadeja and Ashwin pulled things back in the middle overs, but the much haunted death bowling came back to haunt India.",Sri Lanka won by 2 wkts,ODI,India vs Sri Lanka,4
"Facing a Himalayan task, Pakistan needed a sturdy start. Shehzad and Hafeez lent that and set up the platform for Afridi to unleash mayhem on Bangladesh. The hosts did not know what hit them as Afridi produced another blast from his armoury to consign Mushfiqur's men to another heart breaking defeat. Fawad Alam was happy to play the pick-up-truck to Afridi's ferrari. Although both fell at the doorstep of victory, Umar Akmal sealed Pakistan's passage to the final.",Pakistan won by 3 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs Pakistan,3
"Al-Amin Hossain scuppered Sri Lanka's chase, snaring Kusal Perera and Sanga early. Things went from bad to worse when Thirimanne sold Mahela a dummy. But then, Angelo Mathews, borrowing the calmness of sufi saints, anchored the chase to perfection, helping Sri Lanka survive the Bangladesh scare and with it maintain their unbeaten streak in the run-up to the Asia Cup final. The spunky Chaturanga de Silva was unlucky to miss out a fifty of his own but proved the ideal foil for his skipper. ",Sri Lanka won by 3 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka,3
"A deserving win for England. They never looked like losing this game, at least until the final few overs. Ramdin fought hard, scored his first ODI ton, also became the 1st West Indian keeper-batsman to get a ODI ton. But he got very little support from the rest of his mates. The top-order imploded, each batsman following the other in throwing their wicket away. The bowling was tidy, and if not for Ramdin the margin would have been even bigger. England have comeback from being 0-1 down to register a 2-1 series win.",England won by 25 runs,ODI,Windies vs England,3
"England got off to a worst possible start. They lost Hales and Wright in successive deliveries. Lumb was looking good before the pressure of the run rate got the better of him. Morgan started postively but he too could not convert his start. Bopara and Bresnan had some late flourish but the match had already slipped out of their hands. The main concern was the way they handled the spinners. Badree, Narine and Samules shared 6 wickets between them. They were economical and didn't give away any freebies to the batsmen.",West Indies won by 27 runs,T20,Windies vs England,2
"An amazing finish in the end by Sammy after they had lost 2 wickets in 2 balls and needed 40 from 30. Sammy played a sensible hand and muscled 3 sixes to shift the momentum back towards the Carribean side. Earlier the openers had gotten them off to a strong shot with Smith and Gayle firing on all the cylinders. But England fought back well in the middle overs and Bopara bowled a lovely spell conceding just 10 runs from his 4 overs and accounting for Gayle in the process. They lost Samuels and Russell to sucessive balls, but Sammy made sure they finished off on a winning note with a blistering unbeaten innings of 30 from just 9 balls. ",West Indies won by 5 wkts,T20,Windies vs England,4
"It's been a great game of cricket. Never quite sure who's going to win the match until the final ball. West Indies got off to a poor start in the chase by losing quick wickets but Simmons steadied the ship with a gritty fifty. Ramdin too gave him good company but the latter perished in pursuit of some quick runs. Sammy and Simmons tried their level best but couldn't quite hold their nerve to get over the line. Anyway, West Indies win the 3-match series 2-1.",England won by 5 runs,T20,Windies vs England,4
"A convincing performance from Bangladesh and they have all but sealed their entry into the main rounds. The target was hardly challenging, especially with the dew around. The bowling was disciplined but they were simply helpless in front of the assault from the Bangladesh batsmen. Tamim and Anamul started well, and Shakib finished it off in style. Nepal's spinners were undone by the dew, and had no chance of defending the paltry target.",Bangladesh won by 8 wkts,T20,Bangladesh vs Nepal,1
"A convincing performance by Ireland in a match that ended in bizzare circumstances. After having restricted UAE to a modest score, they started off in a fiery fashion. Paul Stirling had to retire hurt after getting a blow on his shoulder. Ed Joyce batted in a positive fashion and was well supported by skipper, Will Porterfield. They lost a clump of wickets towards the end before the match was finished abruptly, thanks to floodlight failure as well as rain. ",Ireland won by 21 runs (D/L method),T20,Ireland vs United Arab Emirates,1
"The Nepal bowlers set the ball rolling, reducing their arch-rivals to 5-50. Then, Shafiuqllah and Shenwari culled the rot briefly with some aggressive batsmanship. Stanikzai battled hard and went down blazing. While the spinners blocked all escape routes in the middle overs, Mukhiya excelled at the death with those Malinga-like accurate yorkers. Nepal's catching was another key ingredient in their victory.",Nepal won by 9 runs,T20,Afghanistan vs Nepal,4
"Wonderful performance from Hong Kong. Irfan Ahmed started off briskly, and for a moment Rahim looked a worried man. Shakib was unplayable tonight, he and the other spinners put Bangladesh right on top. Munir Dar though had different ideas, he kept the score-board ticking with cheeky ones, twos and the occassional boundaries. They again lost their way towards the end, but Amjad was coolness personified in the final over as he completed the victory march.",Hong Kong won by 2 wkts,T20,Bangladesh vs Hong Kong,3
What a match to kick start Super Sunday! The match swung like a pendulum until Pakistan came back strongly to win it. Australia started off poorly as they lost Warner and Watson in the first over. Maxwell and Finch seemed to be playing on a different pitch as they carved the bowling to all parts of the ground. They added 118-runs for the third wicket. Maxwell in particular seemed to be in a hurry as he got his fifty off just 18 balls. He looked well on course for a hundred before throwing it away. Finch carried on even though he kept losing partners at the end. He too got to his fifty but in the end there was too much to do for him.,Pakistan won by 16 runs,T20,Australia vs Pakistan,4
"India register their third comfortable win and become the first team to enter the semis. With this win India are now the No.1 T20 side in the World. It was nicely set up by the spinners and the batsmen didn't make much fuss of the target. Dhawan could not get going as he perished early but it was once again Rohit and Kohli who added a 100-run stand, the second in as many matches to see India through. Dhoni promoted himself up the order and spent some time out in the middle. Bangladesh bowlers did not have much in the bank. They tried their best but could not restrict the two in-form batsmen from playing their shots.",India won by 8 wkts,T20,Bangladesh vs India,2
"Another solid work-out for Brendon McCullum and his men. Guptill flopped again, but the skipper took it upon himself to lead the chase. He was hampered with a bad back, but did not allow that to affect him. He was well supported by the other batsmen as the chase was completed with ease. On the other hand, Netherlands fought bravely once again, and it was only the lack of experience that did them.",New Zealand won by 6 wkts,T20,Netherlands vs New Zealand,2
"It was a clinical run-chase from Australia. They were barely troubled by the shoddy Bangladesh bowlers, who were guilty of erring on the shorter side. Warner and Finch set the tone with a massive 98-run partnership. Both batsmen finally came into their own, wading into the bowling attack. Though both Finch and Maxi fell at the doorstep of victory, Bailey and White got Australia past the finish line to leave the tournament with a win.",Australia won by 7 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs Australia,2
West Indies started the match only after 15 overs. Sammy and Bravo gave them a formidable total. Then the bowlers responded strongly to bowl out the opposition and register the biggest win for their side in T20Is. Badree and Narine showed why they are ranked No. 1 and 2 bowlers in T20Is. Together they picked up 6 wickets and conceded only 26 runs. The rest of the bowlers chipped in and were also well backed up in the field.  ,West Indies won by 84 runs,T20,Pakistan vs Windies,3
"Afghanistan never looked in trouble as they chased down the target. Noor Ali threw away a start but the debutant, Usman Ghani made the most of the opportunity given. He scored a well compiled 70 and the inexperience showed when he played a poor shot when there was a hundred for the taking. Shaidi and Shenwari then added a 64-run stand for the fourth wicket before Shenwari tried to hurry things up. Nabi came out and did light work of the required runs. Hong Kong bowlers were not supported in the field as they put down four catches which did not help their cause.",Afghanistan won by 6 wkts,ODI,Afghanistan vs Hong Kong,3
The UAE innings was based on two partnerships. First between Amjad and Faris who added 70 runs for the opening wicket and then between Amjad and Khurram who stitched a 86-run stand for the fourth wicket. Amjad was looking good for a hundred but fell just short by two runs. Once he got out there was no support for Khurram and he too perished after a while. The Afghan bowlers were led by Rahmat Shah who picked up his maiden five wicket haul and was well supported by the rest of his mates.,Afghanistan won by 70 runs,ODI,Afghanistan vs United Arab Emirates,2
"A disciplined bowling effort by Sri Lanka has helped them defend a low total. 219 was never enough on this track, but the Irish batsmen couldn't handle Mendis and co and lost too many wickets at the start and they could never come back into the game after that. Lakmal and Kula shared 5 wickets between them and provided good support to Mendis. There was some rain during the start of the second innings, but luckily it stayed away and we could get a full game. ",Sri Lanka won by 79 runs,ODI,Ireland vs Sri Lanka,2
"In the end, Sri Lanka hold their nerve to clinch a narrow win by 9 runs. They had England under the mat in the middle overs, but leaked too many runs towards the death and Bopara ignited some hope for England with some lusty blows. However, the Sri Lankan bowlers bowled well at the death and ensured SL didn't fall short. Hales was a slow starter, but he compensated for it later and struck some meaty blows. Most of the batsmen were not able to pick Malinga as the Sri Lankan captain mixed his slower deliveries well and finished with the figures of 3/28 from his 4 overs.",Sri Lanka won by 9 runs,T20,England vs Sri Lanka,4
"It has been a professional display from England in the rain-hit game. First their batsmen got the runs and set-up a huge score for the Sri Lankan batsmen to chase down. Then their bowlers responded well by taking wickets at regular intervals. The visitors never really got going with the bat, Mahela was the only one who looked good at the crease but he too perished at the wrong time. The rest of the batsmen were troubled by Jordan, who was the pick of the bowlers with 3 wickets. He was well supported by the rest of the bowlers.",England won by 81 runs (D/L method),ODI,England vs Sri Lanka,3
"West Indies have comeback well to level the series 1-1. The visitors started off well with McCullum and Williamson going berserk but once Baz fell to Badree, they lost the momentum. Pollard tightened things in the middle with his variations and once the asking rate went up, the New Zealand batsmen failed to get the big hits away. They lost their last 8 wickets for 44 runs. Narine and Badree bowled superbly, while Cottrell also did a good job. ",West Indies won by 39 runs,T20,Windies vs New Zealand,2
"Though the rain made the run chase interesting for a while, India won the game easily in the end. Uthappa and Rahane put on 99 for the first wicket before the former fell very soon after completing his fifty. There was a long rain break and once play resumed, Bangladesh's spinners got some purchase and troubled the Indian batsmen for a short while. Pujara perished immediately after the restart but Rahane continued his fine form and completed his 6th ODI fifty before Ziaur held on to a stunner to dismiss him. Raina and Rayudu then finished the formalitites, helping India to the finish line.",Ind won by 7 wkts (D/L method),ODI,Bangladesh vs India,3
"South Africa finally have the monkey off their back. Chasing 340, Sri Lanka got off to a brilliant start scoring 99 runs in the first 10 overs. Kusal Perera got off the blocks in fine fashion, Dilshan and Sangakkara followed suit. A misunderstanding caused Dilshan's exit, and that was followed by a slump. Mathews fought hard for his 58, but the match was over once he was dismissed.",South Africa won by 82 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,2
"What a thriller! We did not know the winner until the last ball of the game. The game swung like a pendulum. England started off well, by sending Rahane back early. Then Kohli and Dhawan added 79 for the second wicket, the former scoring his first fifty of the tour. He fell just when India were in control. Dhoni and Raina tried their best but some good death bowling did not allow them to score as freely as they would have liked. The Indian skipper kept his side in the game until the final delivery, but was not able to take them past the finishing line.",England won by 3 runs,T20,England vs India,5
"A comprehensive victory for the hosts. The opening stand of Raza and Hamilton added 224 runs and made it a stroll in the park. The latter went on to bring up his maiden ODI hundred, the knock was filled with strokes on both sides of the wicket. Hamilton played second fiddle and missed out on his ton by 7 runs. Taylor then came out and finished things with ease. Afghanistan bowlers didn't have any answers to the onslaught. They kept giving boundaries on a consistent basis and never looked like taking a wicket. The visitors will have a lot to ponder about for the next game.",Zimbabwe won by 8 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,4
Afghanistan have won! What a fantastic game. It is their second ODI win against an ICC full member nation as well as their highest successful ODI run chase. The last few overs were indeed thrilling. The visitors had got off to a fiery start before losing the plot in the middle overs. But sensible batting from the skipper and a cameo by Dawlat Zadran has helped them remain alive in this 4-match series.,Afghanistan won by 2 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,4
"Afghanistan have rumbled back strongly from 0-2 down to level the four-match ODI series. After the Nabi-Shafiqullah show with the bat, the Afghanistan bowlers set the ball rolling, reducing Zimbabwe to 6-29. The story could have been more shameful for the hosts if not for a fighting 64 from Mutumbami. He was the chief aggressor in a 97-run stand with Maruma. Eventually, Zimbabwe folded for 159, giving Afghanistan a big 100-run victory. ",Afghanistan won by 100 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,3
" It's a comfortable win for Sri Lanka, they needed this to keep the series alive. Malinga removed Sharjeel early but Shehzad and Hafeez set up an attacking 96-run stand to fuel the chase. The latter in particular seemed in superb touch, essaying some lovely drives and cuts. However, the Sri Lankan spinners rallied to snatch the initiative from the visitors. The Pakistan batsmen played some rash shots and perished in the process.",Sri Lanka won by 77 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,3
"A professional performance by South Africa. They picked up three early wickets, but Williams and Hamilton Masakadza steadied the innings. The former being the aggressor, both men got to their fifties and threw it away. Once the 100-run stand was broken, Zimbabwe never seemed to go for the victory. Chigumbura was struggling with an injury to his leg, he was unable to run properly and debutant Jongwe tried his best but he too fell trying to accelerate.",South Africa won by 93 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs South Africa,2
"West Indies go 1-0 ahead. Things looked bleak at 34/5, but Ramdin and Pollard almost took them home during the course of a splendid 145-run stand for the 6th wicket. Pollard (89) was sublime and was well supported by Ramdin (74). Bangladesh envisioned fresh hopes of pulling off an upset win when both fell, but Jason Holder held his nerve to steer the hosts home.",West Indies won by 3 wkts,ODI,Windies vs Bangladesh,4
"Once the Tamim-Rahim stand was broken, Bangladesh were never really in the hunt. The asking rate pressure got the better of them and in the end West Indies have completed a massive win. 339 was chasable but the visitors didn't plan their chase properly. Anamul and Kayes played poor shots to put pressure on the rest of the batsmen. Rahim hung around but he couldn't score freely. Rampaul was the pick of the bowlers for the hosts, while the rest supported him very well.",West Indies won by 91 runs,ODI,Windies vs Bangladesh,3
"A throughly professional performace from the Australians. They batted first, started slowly and exploded in the last 10 overs. Zimbabwe had no chance in chasing the target down, but barring Hamiltom Masakadza (70), none of the other batsmen showed any aptitude. Mitchell Johnson was fast while Starc swung the ball to a nicety. The others chipped in with wickets while Steven Smith finished off the tail. Zimbabwe's coach, Steven Mongango, didn't look too plesed with his lads and the hosts have a tough job after this heavy defeat.",Australia won by 198 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Australia,2
"Zimbabwe put Australia under pressure right from the word go. In fact, it was a blessing in disguise that Clarke opted to bat first as they were keen to bowl first. Spin was introduced as early as the second over and the Australian batsmen were never comfortable at the crease. Skipper Clarke though played a sensational innings, he had to retire hurt on 68 due to his troublesome hamstring and then some lusty blows from Haddin and Cutting at the death got them past 200. Clarke came out to bat in the last over as they lost 9 wickets but he didn't face a ball.",Zimbabwe won by 3 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Australia,3
"So a comprehensive win for Australia. Warner held the innings together, despite wickets falling at regular intervals at the start, and ensured that Australia got past the line quite comfortably in the end. Raza Hasan was the pick of the bowlers, picking up 2 wickets in his 4-over spell, while skipper Afridi too got himself into the wickets column. The pacers didn't have a great time and both Irfan and Riaz went for runs.",Australia won by 6 wkts,T20,Pakistan vs Australia,2
"In the end, you would have to say that it was a comfortable 59-run win for India, even though they let West Indies score freely after picking up early wickets. When West Indies were reduced to 121/5, it looked like India were quickly going to wrap things up, but Samuels and Russell hit some lusty blows to keep the game wide open. Samuels scored his 7th ODI hundred, but the Indian bowlers managed to get the breakthroughs at the fag end to dent the visitors.",India won by 59 runs,ODI,India vs Windies,3
"It has been a clinical performance from the South Africans. They never let the New Zealand batsmen to settle down and get the momentum to chase down the target. Guptill and Neesham could not provide the start that their team would have hoped for. Latham, Brownlie and McCullum all got starts, but none could convert it into a big score. Ronchi once again was the standout with the bat. The wicket-keeper showed immense application and was not afraid to play his shots. McClenaghan supported him well and the pair added 76 runs for the last wicket. Because of that partnership there was some respectability to the final score.",South Africa won by 72 runs,ODI,New Zealand vs South Africa,2
"So New Zealand beat Pakistan for the first time in 11 ODIs at Sharjah. The series is now 1-1, with three games to go. When Devcich and Brownline shared a 103-run opening stand, it looked like the visitors were going to win by a big margin, but Pakistan bounced back strongly and reduced the visitors to 167/5. Captain Williamson though, after a sensible fifty from Devcich early on, dropped anchor and ensured that New Zealand crossed the line with 24 balls to spare. He registered his 12th ODI fifty and it was his 6th fifty in his last 7 innings. Apart from Haris Sohail, who picked up three wickets, and Afridi (2 wickets), none of the Pakistani bowlers could trouble the batsmen.",New Zealand won by 4 wkts,ODI,Pakistan vs New Zealand,4
"It's 3-2 currently in the series with two matches to go. But for the last few overs, England paced their run chase very well and it's a well deserved victory for Alastair Cook & Co. The visitors got off to a positive start, but Moeen Ali threw it away. Captain Cook hung around for a while, but the returning Sachithra Senanayake trapped him LBW. James Taylor and Joe Root then steadied the ship with a fine century partnership. Although Taylor was dismissed after his second consecutive fifty, Root carried on and registered his 3rd ODI hundred. England lost a few wickets at the end, but Buttler and Root saw them through. Apart from Senanayake, who got three wickets, none of the Sri Lankan bowlers were impressive.",England won by 5 wkts,ODI,Sri Lanka vs England,4
"It was a Chris Gayle show at Newlands. He ran amok and scored 52 runs at one stage from just 11 balls, completing a 17-ball fifty in the process, the fastest by a West Indian batsman. He looked determined to finish it off on his own. But after his dismissal, for a 31-ball 77, West Indies threatened to undermine all his work. Samuels played a good hand, making a fine 41. The visitors lost a heap of wickets towards the end, but Gayle's knock had placed them in a comfortable position. Nothing much to say about South Africa's bowling, although Tahir impressed once again. The visitors go 1-0 up in the 3-match series.",West Indies won by 4 wkts,T20,South Africa vs Windies,4
"Chasing 232, the intent was pretty clear from Smith and Gayle. Though the former perished early, Gayle bludgeoned the bowling and shared a record 152-run stand for the second wicket with Samuels. It looked like West Indies would win with three overs to spare, but Wiese brought the hosts back by removing both in quick succession. The visitors lost their way slightly as South Africa picked up 5 wickets in a space of 38 runs. However, Sammy stayed calm when it mattered and took West Indies past the line to achieve a record win. Phew! Insane stuff from the Caribbean boys!",West Indies won by 4 wkts,T20,South Africa vs Windies,5
"Scotland gave it their all in defending the paltry 216 that their batsmen put up. At one stage, they had the Irish reeling at 5/100. However, Niall O'Brien held one end up and kept going even as wickets tumbled at the other end. In the end, the elder O'Brien brother remained unbeaten on 80 and took his side home. Wardlaw was the pick of the Scottish bowlers, he was well supported by the rest, but they just didn't have enough runs on the board.",Ireland won by 3 wkts,ODI,Ireland vs Scotland,3
"The Australian bowlers were exceptional. Although Starc had an off-day, the rest of his mates stepped up. Hazlewood was outstanding with the new ball, bowling tight line and lengths, Johnson was at his fearsome best and Maxwell too varied his pace to pick up his career-best figures. The fielding too was terrific as they pulled off some stunners in the field. Overall, it was an all-round performance from the hosts. ",Australia won by 112 runs,ODI,Australia vs England,3
"New Zealand win comprehensively at the end. They got off to a blazing start with Brendon McCullum going hard at the new ball. However, he perished in the fourth over after hitting four boundaries. Guptill and Latham got together and stitched a 44-run stand before the latter departed. Guptill followed soon after and it seemed at one point that they would miss the solidity of Williamson in the middle order. However, Taylor and Elliott then took on the mantle of seeing their team through. Taylor's good form in 2015 continues and Elliott continues to justify his selection in the World Cup squad ahead of Neesham. Both registered fifties and took the hosts home. The Pakistani bowlers bowled well in patches, but nothing to really trouble the Kiwis.",New Zealand won by 7 wkts,ODI ,New Zealand vs Pakistan,3
"Another comprehensive victory for New Zealand. Pakistan started off well through Shehzad and Hafeez, who added 111 runs for the opening stand. Both batsmen got to their respective fifties before the former threw it away. Hafeez kept going, but the climbing run-rate got the better off him. Misbah came out with an attacking mindset, but didn't get any support from the other end. None of the other Pakistani batsmen tried to play themselves in as they all fell while looking for runs.",New Zealand won by 119 runs,ODI,New Zealand vs Pakistan,2
"Another comprehensive win for the Proteas. They have sealed the T20I series 2-0. Soumya Sarkar got Bangladesh off to a blazing start, Tamim struggled but stuck it out for a while before Parnell sent him packing. However, the introduction of spin brought about the downfall of the hosts. Bangladesh were never in the game once they lost Sarkar and Shakib. Leie was excellent with his leg-breaks and was well supported by Phangiso and Abbott. The trio shared 9 wickets between them. A mention should be made of the South African fielding as well as they took some terrific catches.",South Africa won by 31 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs South Africa,3
"At 97/0, Zimbabwe would have had high hopes of bagging a rare series win, but the wickets of Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza and Elton Chigumbura in quick succession hurt them badly. Craig Ervine and Sean Williams were involved in a brisk stand but the former ran himself out. Soon Sikandar Raza gifted his wicket away and with Regis Chakabva too following him shortly, Zimbabwe looked down and out. However, Graeme Cremer gave decent support to Williams, who was fighting hard. The left-hander also recorded a fifty but once that partnership was broken, New Zealand managed to pick wickets at regular intervals and eventually sealed the match with 14 balls to spare. Mitchell McClenaghan was the pick of the bowlers with three wickets, while Ish Sodhi bagged two.",New Zealand won by 38 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs New Zealand,3
"A fine all-round show by the tourists helped them to thrash Zimbabwe in the only T20I. If George Worker essayed an enterprising knock, then the bowlers picked up wickets at regular intervals to restrict the hosts to a meagre total. Adam Milne and Mitchell McClenaghan bowled with a good burst of pace to trouble the opposition ranks and made key breakthroughs. James Neesham, Ish Sodhi and Nathan McCullum were also among the wickets. Zimbabwe never seemed to be in the game after losing early wickets. Only Craig Ervine played a handy knock. New Zealand were also very good in the field. Earlier, Worker on his T20I debut, explored every nook and corner of the ground to smash a fifty. Luke Ronchi and Colin Munro notched up quick-fire cameos in the end overs.",New Zealand won by 80 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs New Zealand,2
"South Africa put up a fine all-round show to overcome the tourists in the first T20I. Hashim Amla held the innings together with a steady knock. Rilee Rossouw and AB de Villiers played breezy knocks as the hosts registered a convincing win. When van Wyk was dismissed, New Zealand had a window of opportunity, but the 50-run stand between de Villiers and Amla put the home team in command. Even though, Rossouw and Amla lost their wickets in the end, the Proteas coasted towards an easy win. Doug Bracewell, Mitchell McClenaghan, Adam Milne and George Worker picked up a wicket apiece, but they needed more from their bowlers.",South Africa won by 6 wkts,T20,South Africa vs New Zealand,2
"The players shake hands with each other and the Australian players are all smiles as they walk back. When the third wicket partnership between Niall O'Brien and Ed Joyce was growing strong, Australia were under serious pressure, but once that stand was broken, the visitors came back well to gain the upper hand. The start wasn't good for Ireland as they lost the openers inside 2 overs, but Ed Joyce and Niall O'Brien steadied the innings. There were a few rain breaks and it looked as if it was going to favour the team batting second, but Australia captured key moments to seal the contest. Nathan Coulter-Nile finished with three wickets, while Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins bagged two apiece.*",Australia won by 23 runs (D/L method),ODI,Ireland vs Australia,2
"Despite putting up a fine all-round show in the field, the hosts slipped towards a defeat. Imad Wasim starred for the visitors by picking up four wickets in his quota of four overs. On a track, where it was stopping on the batsmen, Zimbabwe struggled to counter the unremitting control of Imad. Hamilton Masakadza showed self-belief at top of the order. However, just when it felt as if, he had steadied the innings, Masakadza was dismissed by the man of the moment, Imad. Chigumbura then landed a few powerful blows and stitched a key stand with Utseya, but they had too much to do.",Pakistan won by 13 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,4
"Another abject performance with the bat from the hosts. The top-order fell in a heap and despite the best efforts of Sean Williams and Sikandar Raza, it was a mountain that proved too steep. Chigumbura struck some late blows, but it only lessened the margin of defeat. Once again, Pakistan's bowling turned out to the difference between the two teams. Imad Wasim was impressive once again and the pacers made sure that his efforts didn't go waste.",Pakistan won by 15 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,3
"Miller failed to impress once again and Behardien failed to convert a start. However, de Villiers was growing strong at one end and at one stage it appeared as if he would single-handedly take the Proteas home. Soon after he completed his 22nd ODI hundred, Bhuvneshwar removed him and South Africa could never really recover from the blow. Eventually, Dhoni's boys sealed the contest by 35 runs, but the captain would have ideally wanted his bowlers to bowl the opposition out. Bhuvi bagged three wickets, while Harbhajan picked up two. Mohit, Axar and Mishra bagged a wicket each.",India won by 35 runs,ODI,India vs South Africa,4
"England didn't get to the best of starts as they lost Roy and Root inside the first six overs. Morgan and Hales held the innings together and stitched a 60-run stand for the third wicket. Hales looked good in his stay, but the 20-year old Zafar Gohar nipped him out with a lovely flighted delivery. Morgan soon followed Hales as he missed a straighter one from Malik. Once Morgan got out, it seemed as if Pakistan were right back in the game. Although Taylor and the under-pressure Buttler had a tough initial period, the duo nudged and nurdled their way to a match-winning 117 run partnership and helped England lead this 4-match ODI series.",England won by 6 wkts,ODI,Pakistan vs England,4
"225 was a tricky chase but Sri Lanka handled it pretty well and in the end won the game easily. Just like the previous game, Kusal Perera and Tillakaratne Dilshan got the side off to a great start. Sunil Narine though came on and knocked over the latter first ball with a seam-up ball that swung back in and totally deceived the batsman. Lahiru Thirmanne then joined Perera at the crease and the duo shared a massive 156-run stand for the second wicket to ensure a smooth sail for the hosts. Perera fell 1 run short of what would have been a well-deserved 3rd ODI hundred. By the time he got out, Sri Lanka were well ahead and Dinesh Chandimal and Thirmanne completed the formalities. Barring Narine, none of West Indies' bowlers were impressive.",Sri Lanka won by 8 wkts (D/L method),ODI,Sri Lanka vs Windies,3
"Zimbabwe might have taken it to the 50th over, but they were always in control of the run-chase. Mutumbami looked in good touch as he brought up his third ODI fifty. Cameo from Williams in the middle kept the scoreboard moving. Then the experienced duo of Chigumbura and Raza were calm as they took their team over the finish line. Afghanistan bowled tight line and lengths, but they did not have enough runs on the board. Amir Hamza was the pick of the bowlers as he ended with figures of 3 for 47. Another 15-20 runs would have made the match more interesting.",Zimbabwe won by 6 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,2
"The tourists played with pluck and steel to pull off a thrilling win and seal the series 2-0. Usman Ghani and Mohammad Shahzad gave them a rollicking start with an enterprising stand of 95. However, both of them fell in quick succession. Zimbabwe then clawed their way back into the game by taking wickets at regular intervals. It was Gulbadin Naib, who held the innings together with a determined effort. He remained not out and guided them home. Shafiqullah too played his part with a crucial boundary in the final over. Earlier, Sean Williams and Mutumbami had taken the hosts to a substantial total.",Afghanistan won by 5 wkts,T20,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,2
"A crushing victory for New Zealand. Brendon McCullum was off to a flier, he was well supported by Martin Guptill. The Sri Lankan bowlers didn't know what hit them. McCullum registered his fifty in 23 balls, Guptill was just slightly slower and New Zealand got their team 100 in the 9th over. Both fell but the task had been completed by then. Nicholls helped himself to useful runs as the hosts' chased down the target - with 174 balls to spare.",New Zealand won by 7 wkts,ODI ,New Zealand vs Sri Lanka,2
"A complete performance from Angelo Mathews and his men. The bowlers put up an impressive performance, restricting the hosts to a par score on this pitch. Danushka Gunathilaka was a man on a mission, belting a 45-ball 65. Dilshan was happy to play second fiddle, but took over after his partner fell. He was unlucky to be dismissed in the nervous nineties. Lahiru Thirimanne then ensured that there were no further hiccups as he took his team home, in the company of Dinesh Chandimal.",Sri Lanka won by 8 wkts,ODI,New Zealand vs Sri Lanka,2
"Riding on Luke Jongwe's 5-for, Zimbabwe thrashed their opposition ranks to script a superb turnaround and emerge victorious. With this win, Zimbabwe now trail the series 1-2. Only Mohammad Shahzad checked in a series of shots to keep the scorecard ticking for the hosts. Rest of the batsmen though, fell to Jongwe and Madziva's incisive bowling. The duo shared eight wickets between them. Earlier, Masakadaza and Cremer stitched a key century stand to help the tourists make a smart recovery after they lost a slew of wickets up front. In the end, Zimbabwe's total proved to be too much for Afghanistan.",Zimbabwe won by 117 runs,ODI,Afghanistan vs Zimbabwe,2
"Changes in the batting order didn't help the Zimbabwean cause as they got off to a disastrous start, losing five wickets in quick succession. Their innings never took off as they were reeling at 34/5 early on. Masakadza and Moor then got together for a 71-run stand, but Zimbabwe were always chasing the leather. The Zimbabwean opener got to his fifty, but both Moor and him departed soon after. It was only a matter of time before Afghanistan wrapped things up after that, which they did with the first ball of the 18th over.",Afghanistan won by 81 runs,T20,Afghanistan vs Zimbabwe,2
"The hosts were off to a flier, Warner and Finch meant business, right from the first ball. They were helped along by some ordinary bowling by Ashwin. Bumrah came in and provided the visitors with some relief, Warner fell for 17. Steve Smith and Finch looked in cruise control, until the former was sent back by Jadeja. It was followed by a dramatic collapse. 4 wickets went down in quick succession. The late order had too much to do and ended up throwing their wickets in the process.",India won by 37 runs,T20,Australia vs India,3
"New Zealaned looked like they were coasting towards victory at one stage, but a middle-order meltdown cost them dear. They lost Guptill early, after a horrible misunderstanding with his skipper. It didn't matter a lot, Williamson struggled but fought his guts out, Munro took the attack to the bowling and an easy win was on the cards. Pakistan kept pegging away, Munro was cleaned up for 56, the inexperienced middle-order faltered and Williamson was left to do too much towards the end.",Pakistan won by 16 runs,T20,New Zealand vs Pakistan,3
"New Zealand go 1-0 up in the 3-match series. No one would have thought about this result when the hosts slumped to 99/6 after being asked to bat first. Nicholls and Santner lead the recovery. Henry and McClenaghan made merry towards the end, although the latter was felled by a hostile bouncer. That forced him out of the game and Williamson was left a bowler short. Elliott filled up for the breach, his bowling was disciplined and he was helped along by some reckless batting from Pakistan's openers. Hafeez and Babar Azam led the recovery, but both fell to indiscreet shots. The pressure of the rising rate took its toll on the rest and the tail collapsed badly, despite a brief fight from Sarfraz.",New Zealand won by 70 runs,ODI,New Zealand vs Pakistan,3
"New Zealand take the 3-match series 2-0. Pakistan gave a good account of themselves, but will be probably look back at their own batting collapse which cost them plenty of runs. 291 wasn't going to be an easy chase. It got worse after skipper Brendon McCullum went for a first ball duck. Martin Guptill and Kane Williamson took charge, added a record second wicket stand before both fell in their eighties. Pakistan kept fighting and reduced the hosts to 210/5 when rain finally forced a break in play. Upon resumption, they should have had Ronchi, but he was reprieved by Hafeez and then Corey Anderson got a big share of luck - after umpire Billy Bowden failed to detect a faint edge. Both were dismissed, but New Zealand completed the chase - with 3 wickets and 2 balls to spare.",New Zealand won by 3 wkts (D/L method),ODI,New Zealand vs Pakistan,4
"An easy win for Mortaza's men in the end. 163 was a good total on this track but the Bangladesh batsmen showed patience after losing a few wickets in the middle to seal this one. The experience of Shakib once again did the trick for them, he kept his calm and was amply supported by Nurul from the other end. Earlier, it was the pocket-sized dynamite Mushfiqur Rahim and Sabbir Rahman who got a good partnership in the middle overs to keep Bangladesh in the chase. Zimbabwe will rue their luck, their middle order failed else they could have posted at least 20 more on the board. When they came onto bowl, the hosts never allowed them to settle in and runs kept leaking. This is also the highest run chase by Bangladesh in T20Is.",Bangladesh won by 4 wkts,T20,Bangladesh vs Zimbabwe,3
"After UAE posted a challenging 172 on the board, Oman found it hard to get going. Their innings was dented by a flurry of wickets in the first 7 overs. Opener Zeeshan Maqsood showed some fight and resolve but the rest of the batters couldn't lay bat on ball. In the end, it was a walk in the park task for UAE who cruised through",United Arab Emirates won by 71 runs,T20,Oman vs United Arab Emirates,2
"This was a fierce battle where Pakistan almost turned up - with the ball and in installments. Powered by Bangladesh's top-shelf bowling effort and helped by Pakistan's aversion to singles, a target of 130 resulted and Bangladesh hunted it down but not sans drama. An Amir yorker stunned Soumya Sarkar just when his impending fifty looked set to sail Bangladesh through and then Shakib lost his stumps to spell danger. The Amir-effected wickets sandwiched Mushfiqur Rahim's debatable LBW and hopes then ballooned. Bangaldesh's pursuit for a stable start was cut short earlier, much like Tamim's peekaboo innings which featured a gigantic six before he perished to Irfan in a 4-ball stint. Sabbir Rahman's red-hot form yielded to some Afridi magic but there just weren't enough runs in the bank. Mahmudullah and Mortaza rode on Sami's hospitable no ball-laden over to set up a blockbuster finale against India.",Bangladesh won by 5 wkts,T20,Bangladesh vs Pakistan,2
"A target of 159 isn't so-so and more so on a slow, low Nagpur pitch. Zimbabwe were frugal with runs early on, bowling tight lines until Campbell yielded. His debut at 44 years of age lasted 19 balls for a meager 9 runs. Atkinson went on to score a fifty, the first ever for Hong Kong in a WT20, but Hayat and Chapman failed to hold fort at the other end. The opener couldn't carry on and perished trying to up the ante when the run rate spilled into danger zones. Captain Afzal was dropped on 17 but there was too much left to be done. Flurry of late wickets denied him the strike and both Tiripano and Chatara ended up with two wickets apiece in the win.",Zimbabwe won by 14 runs,T20,Hong Kong vs Zimbabwe,2
"So we have the first lopsided result of the tournament. Hong Kong started well with both bat and ball but didn't take long to lose their way either time. 117 would have taken some defending. And they weren't good enough. The bowlers were disciplined to begin with and managed to curb Shahzad's natural instincts early on. That was before Nadeem's left-arm spin unleashed all evil and opened the floodgates. Shahzad was eventually stalled at 41 mistiming a slog to long-off, and then a spurt of wickets towards the end induced a stutter but Najibullah broke the trance, took the match by the scruff and romped home.",Afghanistan won by 6 wkts,T20,Afghanistan vs Hong Kong,2
