"A clinical chase from the world champions! Smith is greeted with handshakes as he walks back to the changing room guiding his team home. Chasing a tricky target of 264, Warner started off positively. But once again Amir and Junaid were superb with the new ball scalping both the openers. In walked the debutant Peter Handscomb to join his skipper at the crease. He didn't come alone - he brought fortune with him. He was caught on nought off Junaid - but the bowler had overstepped. And sooner, he was dropped on 10. After that, he played sensibly with his leader and threaded a 183-run stand for the third wicket. Smith was impeccable bringing up his eighth century and also went past the 3000-run mark in the process. Pakistanis went defensive and that helped the hosts to maneuver past the danger area during the chase. Travis Head provided the finishing touches and ensured that there weren't any hiccups.",Australia won by 7 wkts, ODI,Australia vs Pakistan,3
"This is a win shoplifted. Absolutely stolen. England had done everything right - put on 350 runs on the board, had the hosts reeling at 63/4 until they encountered Virat Kohli. 27th ODI ton for the man who never disappoints. But Kohli wasn't alone in this, for a change. After Yuvraj had been ""unlucky"" at No.4, leg-glancing one straight to the keeper; after Dhoni had failed to finish the innings, not for the first time of late, in walked Jadhav to smack a 65-ball hundred, an effort that bettered Kohli's. Another chase looked to be boiling over but both the set batsmen fell, 28 runs apart, after a mammoth 200-run stand off just 147 balls. India seeked a finisher, India found a finisher.. in Hardik Pandya's unbeaten 40 off 37 balls that sailed them home.",India won by 3 wkts, ODI,India vs England,5
"Roy and Billings provided the flier at the top, and Morgan and Root played with calm heads in the middle to prevent any panic from materializing after Chahal's double strike. The England skipper rotated the strike wonderfully and almost every half-tracker he faced, disappeared. He couldn't have found a steadier partner in Root. India were indisciplined with the new ball causing Kohli to turn to spin early. The move worked as Chahal bowled beautifully but the damage had been done. Arguably, 147 was at least 20 runs light of a par score here, if not more. That's where Moeen Ali's career-best 2/21 set the game up. India kept losing wickets all the way through which never allowed them to have a proper go. Full credit to England. They assessed conditions better than India, found the right lengths - shorter than a good length - and stuck to it.",England won by 7 wkts, T20,India vs England,2
"What a match! What a turnaround from Bumrah and Nehra at the end. The duo were sensational in their use of off-cutters combined with some brilliant yorkers. The off-cutters more so. They bowled them into the pitch which was mightily responsive to such variation. England were cruising when Stokes and Root were going. But it was always going to be about one wicket on this sluggish pitch. All that into consideration, England will feel they should have got home here. Especially after plundering 16 off the penultimate over to leave just 8 to get off the final one. But it was Bumrah's day to emerge as the hero. India are alive in the series.",India won by 5 runs, T20,India vs England,5
"308 was always going to be a difficult target on a pitch where the ball was stopping and holding. But it was made almost improbable with the way South Africa fielded. The hosts were on fire in the field. A couple of brilliant catches, a swift stumping, a run out through a direct hit. They were relentless. Sri Lanka had a promising start but it didn't take long for them to lose their way from 45/1 to 75/4. Chandimal and Gunaratne raised hopes of some sort of recovery but Gunaratne's run out put paid to that. Chandimal's wicket soon afterwards snuffed out any last hope that Sri Lanka had and the game was reduced to a formality around the 25-over mark.",South Africa won by 121 runs, ODI,South Africa vs Sri Lanka,2
"So close yet so far. But Sri Lanka finally played like an international team. After being pulped by du Plessis's career-best effort, Tharanga played like the leader Sri Lanka had craved on this tour. For most part of the innings, they were on top but South Africa had the belief. Such is the cruel story of big chases, nothing is enough. Even a brief phase of couple of wickets can dent prospects and that is what happened. Tahir went for some runs but chipped in with a few wickets when the tourists were closing in on the target. Nonetheless, the loss shouldn't dishearten the Lankans who, perhaps, played their best match on the tour and managed to score their highest ODI total in South Africa.",South Africa won by 40 runs, ODI,South Africa vs Sri Lanka,3
" Chasing 385, they lost 5 wickets inside 15 overs. A 97-run stand between Gunaratne and Pathirana followed, and then the former went all guns blazing towards the end, claiming his maiden ODI ton in the process. South African bowlers, bar Morris, were quite off radar today. Didn't turn up at all. Not particularly impressed with AB's captaincy for he didn't go for the kill once Sri Lanka lost half their side. ",South Africa won by 88 runs, ODI,South Africa vs Sri Lanka,2
"Phew, Sri Lanka win. A target of 170 wasn't intimidating on a good track but those three sixes by Mangaliso Mosehle in the last over threatened to really conspire against a contest. Didn't. Niroshan Dickwella's maiden fifty carried them. And so did Seekkuge Prasanna's cameo of 37 off 16 balls to sail Sri Lanka through. South Africa dropped a lot of catches. Like a lot. There was a time when they dropped three off three consecutive balls - some tough, some not so much. So they can't blame anyone but themselves. A really good game in the end to end an amazing T20I series",Sri Lanka won by 5 wkts, T20,South Africa vs Sri Lanka,4
"Winning is a habit; and if you have not developed it, it comes hard. Bangladesh were 105/1 in the 23rd over. While they were not completely in the driver's seat, they were not lagging either. Chase was on. The two set batsmen were Kayes (43) and Sabbir Rahman (38). Both seemed in no hurry, having bade their time. A horrendous run-out led way for senseless shot making and it was followed by some good deliveries from the hosts. The infamous collapse, which separates nervy teams from consistent ones, was making its presence felt. In the next 10 overs, they lost 6 wickets and added 40! That's it. New Zealand had throttled them. Formalities took a little while to get completed but Bangladesh's fate was sealed much earlier - first signs of which were two set batsmen running towards the same end... in the 23rd over. But remember this was not a self immolation by any stretch. New Zealand ployed that. Never lost the belief and bowled some tight lines. Easy runs were never on offer and that tightened the noose. And when the time was opportune, they cashed in to go 2-0 up in the series!",New Zealand won by 67 runs, ODI,New Zealand vs Bangladesh,4
"New Zealand finish Bangladesh off at a canter to complete a clean sweep. The pair of Williamson and Broom were brilliant in their 179-run partnership after the hosts got off to a slightly rocky start. Latham was dismissed early and Guptill was forced to retire hurt through an unfortunate hamstring injury. Bangladesh had the opportunity to remove Broom for nought, only for Kayes to spill a straightforward catch at slip. There was no coming back from there. At one stage, both batsmen looked set to get a century apiece. Eventually, neither did. Broom was foxed by Mustafizur to end up three runs short, whereas Williamson quite selflessly empowered Neesham to finish the game and himself remained unbeaten on 95.",New Zealand won by 8 wkts, ODI,New Zealand vs Bangladesh,2
"It was a sub-par total that looked all the more timid considering the batting might Australia possessed. But New Zealand started like a dream and before the tourists could realize they were 6 down. Recuperation is a painful process and it was not a different one today. Faulkner was being unlike himself. Took 36 balls to find the fence for the first time but managed to hang in and that is what Stoinis needed. Hope! That he got from his partner and as far as the belief was concerned, he had it much more than any guy playing his second ODI will have. With Faulkner leaving him mid-way, Stoinis unleashed all he had. Was supported by some mediocre fielding efforts and ordinary bowling. But just when it mattered the most, Williamson kept his calm and hit the target to make sure that New Zealand did not lose the greatest ODI match of 2017.",New Zealand won by 6 runs, ODI,New Zealand vs Australia,4
"What a game. Both sides had a sniff at a win once, both sides seemed to have bungled the advantage once, but both recovered.. New Zealand just enough to snatch home a 2-0 series win in the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. 281 was an about-par score lacking intimidation, and at 44/0, Australia seemed to be on course Boult picked two in an over - eighth of the innings - and then Williamson's spell graduated into Australia's doom. He went for 11 runs in his first over, seven in the next, and then had a well-set Finch in his third. And from thereon, every over was an advocation of Williamson's immense self-belief and in his Sodhi's non-selection on a pitch expected to be slow.",New Zealand won by 24 runs, ODI,New Zealand vs Australia,4
"A typical T20 chase. More drama towards the back end, but eventually the better side emerged victorious. Tharanga's dismissal in the first over didn't dent the confidence of the youngsters; at least in terms of experience. Dickwella, Munaweera, Gunaratne went all guns blazing and piled almost 70 percent of the target. The rest of the total was all about holding your nerve and cruising past the finishing line. Any T20 game would be boring without a few jittery moments. Australia did create a few, thanks to Ashton Turner and Andrew Tye, but the young Lankan side had the final laugh.",Sri Lanka won by 5 wkts, T20,Australia vs Sri Lanka,4
"What a game this turned out to be. 5-1.. 22-2.. 27-3.. 40-4.. 40-5.. inside the fifth over and Sri Lanka have managed to pull off a win from there, gee! Let's be honest: on a pitch that was holding up right through, a target of 174 was above par. But then again, Sri Lanka are going through one of the phases that feels like Meryl Streep's Hollywood career. They just find ways to make a mark, and win. Kudos to Gunaratne for walking in when the match looked lost, persevering and timing the big hits when most people surrender to their nerves and give up. 50 runs were scored off the last three overs and an innings of 84 off 46 from Gunaratne took Sri Lanka to a mighty good series win. Great follow-up to the one in South Africa. Fun fact: Australia have never beaten Sri Lanka in a T20I on their home soil",Sri Lanka won by 2 wkts, T20,Australia vs Sri Lanka,5
"Dominant performance from the hosts. They were at it right from the start. Never allowed the Afghan innings to flourish; were definitely helped by the bouts of rain that hampered the momentum of tourists, if there were any. Coming into bat, there were not any hiccups. They got to a good start and despite a couple of wickets at the fag end, were able to get to the finish-line with ease.",Zimbabwe won by 7 wkts, ODI,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,2
"A big win for Afghanistan rounds up their third series win in Zimbabwe. The series was nicely poised at 2-2, with hosts boasting of all the momentum with two back-to-back wins. The Harare Sports Club was choked with people, only for Zimbabwe to yield to Afghanistan. And rains. And how! After Afghanistan's 253, rains arrived to delay the second innings and the revised target for Zimbabwe happened to be 161 off 22 overs, something which proved too tall. Dawlat Zadran and Amir Hamza ran riot at the top of the order, Zimbabwe panicked and lost the rest of the wickets to brain fog.",Afghanistan won by 106 runs (D/L method), ODI,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,3
"Phehlukwayo could pull it off the other day but today things were a little different. For most part of his innings, he was under the shadow of some mind-boggling hitting from Pretorius. But once Pretorius departed, things became a little too difficult for the tourists. Great come back from New Zealand. Having put just enough runs on the board, they got some early wickets but it was only when they got rid of Miller and ABD in quick succession, things started looking bright for them. However, before they could settle in, South Africa counterattacked to signal that the game was not over. In the end it required a classic over from Boult to seal the deal for the hosts.",New Zealand won by 6 runs, ODI,New Zealand vs South Africa,5
"Martin Guptill's comebacks make for great stories. This is another one. Replaced Latham at the top of the order and smacked 180* off just 138 balls - the highest ODI score by a New Zealand batsman against South Africa and the second highest individual score at Hamilton. This innings has been a treat to watch. He's been lucky but to play an innings like that, on a pitch as slow as this, takes something. Sometimes, you have to stand and applaud.",New Zealand won by 7 wkts, ODI,New Zealand vs South Africa,3
"A massive win. At the halfway mark, New Zealand looked favourites after restricting South Africa to 185/6. But then, Morris feasted on Glenn Phillips' debut nerves, bowling a double-wicket maiden to derail the chase in the very beginning, and some stubborn lack of application by the middle order caught New Zealand by surprise in the only T20I. Tahir, the World No. 1, had a five-for to his name and Phehlukwayo chipped in with three timely wickets: Williamson, Anderson and Santner.",South Africa won by 78 runs, T20,New Zealand vs South Africa,4
"Smiles all round. Bangladesh deserve this. They really do. They have out-batted, out-bowled and out-fielded Sri Lanka. Chasing 325 was always going to be an arduous task. Mortaza got Bangladesh off to a dream start, prising out Gunathilaka in the first over of the innings. Mendis and Tharanga followed him soon. Chandimal and Gunaratne steadied the ship for a while but the latter couldn't convert his start. Chandimal waged a lone battle but lost his wicket trying to up the ante. Thisara Perera struck some lusty blows towards the end but the ever mounting run-rate proved to be a demon and devoured the hosts. Earlier, on the back of Tamim's century and fifties from Shakib and Sabbir propelled Bangladesh to 324. They backed up their batsmen with some disciplined bowling and romped home with ease in the end.",Bangladesh won by 90 runs, ODI,Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh,3
"Sri Lanka level the series and also end their winless run of 7 matches in ODIs. They were the hungrier team today, right from the start of the match when Tharanga and Gunathilaka delivered a brisk start. Bangladesh clawed back in during the middle stages but Thisara Perera's fifty ensured a very competitive total of 280. That total started to look very big as Bangladesh were reduced to 11/3 with Kulasekara and Lakmal bowling splendidly well. Shakib and Sarkar entertained a brief counter-attack but once that was quelled, there was a flurry of wickets. Dilruwan Perera and Seekuge Prasanna found enough turn in the pitch to be brave enough to toss it up and wrecked Bangladesh's hopes. The match was killed halfway during the chase. Mehedi Hasan impressed lower down but it was always going to be in a losing cause. With this, Sri Lanka preserve the record of never losing an ODI series to Bangladesh.",Sri Lanka won by 70 runs, ODI,Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh,3
"West Indies were in the game but once Carlos Brathwaite was out in the 45th over, with West Indies needing 73 off 34 balls, the hosts lost out on an outside chance as well. Ben Stokes didn't bowl at all in the innings, but on a pitch where spinners should have thrived, Woakes and Plunkett shared eight wickets between them. West Indies looked the most comfortable when Rashid and Moeen bowled in tandem, but once the pacers took over, again, wickets fell - some to panic, some to sheer pace, or the lack of it.", England won by 45 runs, ODI,Windies vs England,4
"West Indies did look favourites once, when England lost 4 for 16. Morgan, Stokes, Buttler and Moeen were the wickets to fall in a heap but Holder erred in bowling out his spinners Bishoo and Nurse - the two responsible for the mid-innings collapse - as early as the 29th over, and then happened to be sheer unlucky in losing Gabriel to a side strain. Only three overs from his premier fast bowler didn't help, and so didn't dropped catches - some tough, some not so much. The pitch was turning big but Woakes and Root piled on an unbeaten 102-run stand for the sixth wicket and sailed England to a series win with a match to go.",England won by 4 wkts, ODI,Windies vs England,4
"Ireland will derive a lot of satisfaction from this win. After repeated collapses from the middle order during run-chases on this tour, they have finally managed to find a fix. Stirling played wonderfully well for his 99 to set the chase up, but his dismissal at a crucial juncture gave the sense that the same script would unfold all over again. It wasn't to be. Balbirnie was having none of it. The key to Ireland's success lay in how they kept Rashid Khan at bay. The leg-spinner, who previously spun circles around the Ireland batsmen, went wicketless today. The use of the sweep against him, especially from Balbirnie, stood out. When not sweeping, they played him late and nudged him around for singles. Once his threat was negated, the pitch was good enough for the target to be achieved comfortably. With this, Ireland stay alive in the ODI series.",Ireland won by 6 wkts, ODI,Afghanistan vs Ireland,3
"What a turnaround from Afghanistan! With this, they extend their winning streak in T20Is to 10 matches and also seal this series with a game to spare. The rain break might have disrupted Ireland's momentum, but take nothing away from Rashid Khan. The 18-year-old leg-spinner ran through the Irish middle and lower order to take a five-for inside two overs. It was his googly which did most of the damage as the panic-stricken batsmen failed to pick anything out of the hand.",Afghanistan won by 17 runs, T20,Afghanistan vs Ireland,5
"Afghanistan's winning streak lives on. They have now won 11 T20Is in a row. The match was set up with the bat; with Nabi and Shahzad registering brilliant performances. 234 was always going to be improbable. Credit to Ireland though for showing a lot of fight. Their openers, Stirling and Thompson, gave them a flier and propelled them ahead of the rate. But what Ireland really needed was for one of them to bat right through. That wasn't to be. Afghanistan kept chipping away at the wickets at crucial times which ensured that they were in control after the 10-over mark despite a valiant fifty from Wilson. Rashid Khan impressed once again by proving to be economical and wrapping it up towards the end with a triple-strike.",Afghanistan won by 28 runs, T20,Afghanistan vs Ireland,4
"What a turnaround for West Indies. Their bowlers set up the platform, restricting Pakistan to a meagre 137. And then their batsman - Evin Lewis never gave a whiff to the visitors with his belligerent 91. Rest of the batsmen played second fiddle to him. Lewis though fell at the doorstep of victory and it was Simmons, who applied the finishing touches, helping his side romp home with 37 balls to spare. West Indies have thrown life into this series now with this win. A rare off-day for Sarfraz and his boys. Must be a humiliating defeat for sure, but they just didn't have enough runs on the board.",West Indies won by 7 wkts, T20,Windies vs Pakistan,2
"An easy outing for the Englishmen who were at the top of the game. They have ticked most boxes today, starting with Adil Rashid who returned his maiden fifer in ODIs. Chasing was never going to be a headache and Hales's fifty made it a cakewalk. Root continues to churn up runs. Remained not-out on 49 and Bairstow provided finishing touches. Ireland have a lot to improve on. They needed to bring their A-game out against the mighty neighbours but could not really kick off after a decent start in the first five overs.",England won by 7 wkts, ODI,England vs Ireland,3
"In the end a comfortable win for South Africa but not before it exposed their inability to handle the ball when it does something off the track. England were a little complacent coming into the game. Ended up resting a few players and then lost 6 wickets inside 5 overs. From thereon it was always the catching-up game. Willey and Bairstow ensured that they had something to play but that was never enough. And after South Africa got off to a solid start, only formalities were needed. England have tested all their weapons so far. Might have finalized the team they would want to field in the Champions Trophy. Bairstow's innings today will only add to their belief.",South Africa won by 7 wkts, ODI,England vs South Africa,3
"When they decided to bat it was thought to be a brave move, when they somehow crawled to 212.. it was touted as something respectable. But a few hours later, they have had the last laugh. West Indies looked clueless in the chase, were too defensive to begin with and when Rashid Khan came to strike back to back, they were exposed further. Rashid Khan's bowling performance - 8.4-1-18-7 - today is also the 4th best bowling figures in ODIs and it has helped Afghanistan script their own little history.",Afghanistan won by 63 runs, ODI,Windies vs Afghanistan,3
"Is it a win? Well, on papers it surely is. But for a team that restricted the opposition on 135 and then wasted 6 wickets and almost 40 overs to get to the target on a pitch that did not have any demons, it is struggle. A struggle that does not reflect good on their reputation. In hindsight, Afghanistan would think that 50 more runs and they might have sealed the series. The harsh truth is no West Indian seems confident against Rashid Khan and that will be the imperious question worrying them a couple of days from now when they meet the visitors for the final clash.",West Indies won by 4 wkts, ODI,Windies vs Afghanistan,2
"The chase done and dusted without breaking sweat. Ask Marlon Samuels how? He launched himself time and again, taking calculated risks, and in the process produced a man of the match performance. He hit his highest score in T20Is, and not to forget Jason Mohammed's contribution who manoeuvred strike often making sure Samuels doesn't lose his rhythm. Those little things and Afghanistan's shabby fielding meant West Indies maintain a clean slate so far in the tour.",West Indies won by 7 wkts, T20,Windies vs Afghanistan,3
"When bad times reign, you find a way to lose. Sri Lanka had it all figured out, having stumbled their recent nemesis India from an unsurprising 109/0 to a stuttering 131/7. Dananjaya could have been the hero of his own script, having punched holes into India's middle-order experimentation with a six-wicket haul in his first innings against India. And then, Bhuvneshwar happened, matching every defence for an equally impregnable facial guise. His maiden ODI half-century not just distilled India out of an embarrasing loss but ramped them to a win, too, aptly twinning with a fidgety, cluelessly brilliant, innings from the ex-captain himself.",India won by 3 wkts (DLS method), ODI,Sri Lanka vs India,4
"This match, as much as I'd like for it to be otherwise, would probably be remembered for the wrong reasons. But let it not distract from how good this partnership has been. From a position of 61/4, with Dananjaya having struck twice in two overs, it had all the potential to go awry for India. But Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni have played wonderfully well to make it home at a canter. This is just the knock Rohit needed to get him into the groove for the season ahead, after he was rested from the Windies tour. And Dhoni, how good has he been in these last two games, allowing his partners to thrive with his calming influence at the other end in order to shepherd the team home. Let's not forget about Bumrah too, setting the game up with a five-for. What a series he's having!",India won by 6 wkts, ODI,Sri Lanka vs India,3
"Sri Lanka's chances of direct qualification into 2019 World Cup keeps getting grim with each passing game. While Chasing 375, losing 3 wickets inside 10 overs is the last thing you want. Sri Lanka's batsmen didn't display any application. Except Mathews, no-one showed any intent to spend some time at the crease. A couple of run-outs didn't help their cause either, and as a result, they find themselves on the verge of a whitewash against India.",India won by 168 runs, ODI,Sri Lanka vs India,2
"2-0 to England. West Indies can't win the series from here. It would have taken something really special for them to chase down 370, even with the pitch being as good as it was, and the boundaries being as short as they were. For a brief while, Gayle entertained prospects of producing that 'something special'. But that was before his running between the wickets let him down yet again. The innings didn't take time to disintegrate from there.",England won by 124 runs, ODI,England vs Windies,2
"Match abandoned, England win by DLS. It was literally in the last 20-30 minutes of the game that they robbed it from the West Indies, who would've felt in absolute control after reducing the hosts from 126/0 to 181/5. But Moeen Ali and Jos Buttler stunned them with a brutal onslaught, plundering 51 in the last four overs that were possible. Spare a thought for Alzarri Joseph, who became the youngest Windies fast bowler to take a five-for, and he did it in one spell. Even more so, spare a thought for Evin Lewis, who would have probably coasted to a double-century if he wasn't forced to retire-hurt on 176*. 3-0 to England with a game to go. ",England won by 6 runs (DLS method), ODI,England vs Windies,5
"A really smart turnaround from the Windies, after a forgettable powerplay. They quickly understood that change of pace was the key on this surface, and brought England down to a grinding halt after the Hales onslaught. It was the spinners who turned the tide when Windies were running for cover. Narine and Nurse, between them, took three wickets in three overs soon after they were introduced. The pacers followed suit with an assortment of slower balls, never allowing England to get away even when Bairstow and Buttler were building a little partnership. That pressure eventually got to the hosts and they fell apart towards the end.",Windies won by 21 runs, T20,England vs Windies,4
"Good performance from the Indians. These reduced games always help the team chasing. That wasn't the case today. Well, Australia's revised target was 164 in 21 overs. The visitors never got going in their chase. The Gujarati-duo of Hardik Pandya and Bumrah set the tone early in the innings with the new ball. When three of your top four fall for single digit scores, it'll always be a tough ask for the lower-middle order batsmen. Glenn Maxwell came out all guns blazing and he took special liking to Kuldeep Yadav hitting three successive sixes. However, he was soon scalped by Chahal, who finished with impressive figures: 5-0-30-3. Faulkner in the end tried his best with the bat, but it was too big a task for the Australian all-rounder.","India won by 26 runs (DLS method - reduced to 21 overs due to rain, target 164)", ODI,India vs Australia,3
"India go 2-0 up in the series. Their bowlers have done a fantastic job yet again to convincingly defend a total which was around par, you would imagine. This bowling group is functioning so brilliantly in tandem, with wicket-taking options from top to bottom. Bhuvneshwar Kumar set the tone with a masterclass of swing and seam bowling at the start, swinging circles around the Aussie batsmen and dismissing both openers cheaply. Smith and Head revived the innings for a while, but that was before the wrist-spinners took over again. Arguably, Chahal was the more impressive one with impeccable control over his flight, and he absolutely shackled the middle-order. But then Kuldeep just came back in and claimed a hat-trick for himself. Just shows the luxuries Virat Kohli possesses right now.",India won by 50 runs, ODI,India vs Australia,4
"When the rains came, the match was headed towards a potentially thrilling finish. This looked like the perfect opportunity for Manish Pandey and Kedar Jadhav to rise to the occasion and lift all the scrutiny they've recently been under. While they did impress briefly upon resumption, the duo threw it away and couldn't get the job done. It would be remiss of me to take any credit away from how the Australian pacers pulled things back at the death. Richardson, in particular, was super impressive with the variations in pace and lengths. So Australia have their first ODI win overseas after quite a while. Finch and Warner set it up with the bat, and then their pacers clinched it from a tight spot. They did need a slice of brilliance in the field from their captain to get rid of a fluent Rohit, who would've taken the game away quickly had he stayed any longer. We'll be hearing from him soon enough in the presentations..",Australia won by 21 runs, ODI,India vs Australia,4
"India and their chances were never in doubt. Only rain could have changed the outcome of this game. The game was won in the first innings with bowlers creating all sorts - on a tricky Ranchi pitch - to the Australian batsmen. It seemed as if rain might have the final say after it consumed nearly two hours of play. But once, it relented...India started off the chase with 'skates-on' mode. Two of India's best batsmen in the limited overs were on the extreme ends of a yawning run-chase. Rohit blazed the innings off with a four and Kohli capped with something similar.",India won by 9 wkts (Target 48 in 6 ovs due to rain - DLS method), T20,India vs Australia,3
"Smiles in the Pakistan camp. A perfect all-round performance from Sarfraz and Co. The players exchange handshakes as they walk off the field. This is Pakistan's fifth consecutive win. On the contrary, Sri Lanka's eighth consecutive ODI loss - their worst since 1999. After Pakistan set a target of 293, Lanka were always under the hammer. A ton from Babar and an attacking 81 from Malik had set the tone. The visitors started off on a quick note before Raees nipped out Dickwella and Chandimal. The latter ended up wasting the only review after he was given out LBW. Then the off-spinners took over and wickets continued to fall at regular intervals. Thirimanne complied a half-century and Dananjaya hung in there till the end with an unbeaten 50 - his first in ODIs. But could only reduce the losing margin; It turned out, they couldn't come anywhere close to the target as Pakistan romped home comfortably..",Pakistan won by 83 runs, ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,3
"Is there a better bowling unit than Pakistan when the surface aids them? Tough one to call. The wicket was two-paced and the ball was hardly coming on to the bat and the spin troika of Hafeez, Shadab and Malik made Sri Lanka submit meekly. The combined bowling figures read: 23-1-88-5. Dickwella and Mendis fell early to the pacers. Tharanga and Thirimanne defied proceedings with a dodgy stand, once that was broken the floodgates opened and the slide turned into a procession. The Sri Lankan skipper kept his side in the game with a scratchy hundred and 76-run 8th wicket stand but ran out of partners. At the end, he remained unbeaten and in the process became the first Sri Lankan opener to carry his bat in an ODI.",Pakistan won by 32 runs, ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,4
"If you have just tuned in, don't mistake this for a shortened game. Pakistan, right from the word go, were never short on intent; Usman Khan - playing his second game - wreaked havoc with the ball and inflicted insurmountable pressure on the Sri Lankan batting line-up in the opening burst, recording his maiden fifer in international cricket while at it. All that in the space of 6.3 overs. From that point, there was no room for recovery. Thisara Perera's 25 stood out in what seemed like an atrocious and apalling scorecard. A defeat that should scare the devil out of their system. For Pakistan, it was just a walk in the park. A sweet revenge after being cleanswept in the Test series.",Pakistan won by 9 wkts, ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,3
"Another comprehensive performance from Pakistan. They've continued right where the left off from the ODI series. Their bowlers, all six of them, were among the wickets this evening to bundle Sri Lanka out for 102. And that was the game right there. There was a bit of a flutter early on with a couple of quick wickets. But the arrival of Shoaib Malik, who looked in absolutely brilliant touch, made it a cruise for the hosts. ",Pakistan won by 7 wkts, T20,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,2
"Yet another one-sided affair. Everything went right for the hosts from the toss. Faf had no hesitations to bat on a belter and the batsmen took full advantage of it. The openers set the perfect foundation with a brisk century stand. Bangladesh, in the form of Mehidy Hasan, picked two quick wickets and that was the only moment in this match where Bangladesh found an opening. But, Bangladesh allowed their opponents to settle. du Plessis and Markran shared a century stand for the third wicket. Just when the South African skipper was approaching towards a ton, a lower back injury forced him to leave the field. Bangladesh were at their best with the ball in the final ten overs, but enough damage was done as the Proteas ended up posting their highest-ever ODI total versus Bangladesh.",South Africa won by 200 runs, ODI,South Africa vs Bangladesh,3
"If you weren't very excited going into this series, you should be now. New Zealand have created history at the Wankhede, largely without breaking a sweat (I say that metaphorically). They've done it through two extraordinary batting performances. When Tom Latham and Ross Taylor came together, the scenario was looking pretty grim for the visitors after losing three wickets in pretty much no time. But they didn't let the situation get to them. They rotated strike early, never allowed the spinners to dominate, and got the boundaries at timely intervals. India knew they were just one wicket away from getting into the inexperienced lower-order, but that wicket never came, not until the match was almost done.",New Zealand won by 6 wkts, ODI,India vs New Zealand,4
"What a thrilling game of cricket, and what a fitting finish to this series! A game which New Zealand will look back on as a missed opportunity to register a historic series win in India. They had it with Latham and Nicholls going strong, as deep as the 46th over mark. Especially with Latham looking in other-wordly touch. But lo and behold, Jasprit Bumrah, India's best bowler all evening, came back and bowled a couple of spectacular overs at the death. The pressure he exerted was enough for New Zealand to descend into panic, causing them to blow a golden opportunity. Almost making it a habit to pull off these cliffhangers in India's favour. Excellent yorker bowling.",India won by 6 runs, ODI,India vs New Zealand,5
"There are ways to reverse a 12-match losing streak, and then there is this. Hand India an absolute drubbing, with 176 balls and an entire sunset session going waste. Smiles, hugs, high fives in the Lankan dressing room..oh you've been missed. 113 was never going to be threatening, they did give the Indians a sniff, but Tharanga, his luck, and his edges sealed it. And Dickwella came in to have some fun. But that's only the icing. The real choclate in the cake came in the form of Lakmal's 10-4-13-4. Also India's desperation to seek practice sessions out of international games with batsmen of dodgy techniques.",Sri Lanka won by 7 wkts, ODI,India vs Sri Lanka,2
"Gosh, don't put down this win to just Sri Lanka's ineptitude. Yes, Indian bowlers had 180 odd runs to defend but they also had buckets of dew to contend with. Against two wristspinners bowling this late at Cuttack, Sri Lanka had equal stakes in the game, something that India's spinners chipped away with refreshing display of flight and spin, defying the dew like it never arrived. Rohit Sharma took his time between the overs, wiping the ball, and thus dictating the pace of the game. Undakat got the bowling off to a great start, flummoxing Sri Lanka with his cutters and the spin-twins, Chahal and Kuldeep, followed up beautifully. Six wickets between them, and that twinned with Dhoni-Pandey partnership towards the end sunk Sri Lanka.",India won by 93 runs, T20,India vs Sri Lanka,2
"Fair play to Kusal Perera for going after it, but come on, Sri Lanka were never in this. And then they collapsed dramatically, losing 8 wickets in 25 balls with India's wrist-spinners exacting their retribution for all the punishment suffered at the hands of Perera. With this win, India have now sealed the T20I series with a 2-0 lead. It was pretty much sealed at the halfway mark. Oh this was bad, even for Sri Lanka - after all their sufferings on this tour. Whatever soul they had left coming into Indore, Rohit Sharma destroyed it as he equalled the fastest T20I hundred.",India won by 88 runs, T20,India vs Sri Lanka,2
"A very convincing win for the Kiwis in the end. With the pitch easing out considerably as the game progressed, 248 was never going to be enough for the WI and that's what transpired. The new-look opening pair of Worker (stroked a fifty) and Munro did the damage upfront with a century stand in quick time to virtually kill the chase. Although both fell in successive overs, the middle order had no real pressure and they knocked off the runs rather easily despite losing a few more wickets along the way. Williamson got a start while Taylor was there till the end to see his side through. Debutant Astle made his dream debut more wonderful with a couple of power hits. For the Windies, debutant Beaton was the only impressive bowler while the others found their radar too late in the game to make any impact.",New Zealand won by 5 wkts, ODI,New Zealand vs Windies,3
"There's nothing Windies can take out of it. They have been outplayed in the series. Today was their best chance though. Rain never allowed New Zealand to gain the momentum and a curtailed match almost made it a T20 fixture, something which the Caribbeans love to be part of. However, it was a nightmarish start for them. Gayle went in the first over and it led to a procession that just did not stop. At one stage, they were 9/5 but Holder held one end and saved the blushes. Misery is over, at last.","New Zealand won by 66 runs (DLS method, reduced to 23 overs per side due to rain, target 166)", ODI,New Zealand vs Windies,2
"Not a win for Windies on this tour. Two Tests, 3 ODIs and 3 T20Is have fallen short of warming them up. Today's been another hammering. Started with Munro and Guptill racking up a 136-run stand and continued into the second innings, when Southee struck twice in his opening over accounting for the openers, Gayle being one of them. Andre Fletcher was the only player who looked like taking Windies close but Ish Sodhi set him up beautifully. And from there, all felt like a formality, much like this tour has",New Zealand won by 119 runs, T20,New Zealand vs Windies,2
"So Ireland equalise and in style. Having posted a decent enough total on this track, they never allowed the Afghans to get going. While the wickets were intact for a fair bit of time, the required run-rate kept going up, eventually sucking the Afghans into playing some nothing shots. Credit must be given to Irish fielders as well; they cut down on easy singles and maintained the pressure. After being outplayed in the first game, this is the kind of performance one would have expected from Ireland who now will have the momentum going into the final ODI two days from now.",Ireland won by 51 runs, ODI,Afghanistan vs Ireland,3
"After an absolute drag in the first half, we were treated to some mindful and serene batting from Ireland. Paul Stirling took it upon himself to anchor this chase with a calm head on his shoulders; stitching a pivotal 62-run stand with Balbirnie for the second wicket and thereby, blocking Afghanistan's hopes of a comeback. The stocky right-hander went gung-ho against Shapoor Zadran who ended up conceding 71 - nearly 40 percent of the target - off the 7 overs he bowled. The momentum Ireland gathered in the last game certainly worked wonders and they now have clinched their maiden bilateral series win against Afghanistan.",Ireland won by 5 wkts, ODI,Afghanistan vs Ireland,3
"That's a comprehensive win for West Indies to begin this tour after losing both their warm-up matches to India A. Smith gave a strong start, and that stand between Samuels and Ramdin took them past 300. India were definitely capable of chasing that, but some tight bowling from Rampaul, and disciplined lines from medium-pacers put India in trouble at 114 for 5. Samuels also got two wickets and whatever Ambrose said in the team huddle during the innings break seems to have worked",West Indies won by 124 runs, ODI,India vs Windies,3
"So Sri Lanka have fallen apart in this massive chase of 364. Their openers were troubled a lot by all three pacers - Umesh, Aaron and Ishant. Making a comeback, Ishant bowled beautifully to remove Dilshan and Sanga. Their hopes rested on Jayawardene then as he found gaps regularly before the spinners struck and removed him too. Akshar Patel was very economical to give India their second biggest win against Sri Lanka.",India won by 169 runs, ODI,India vs Sri Lanka,3
"Hasan Khan had struck with his first ball and struck with what turned out to be the last ball of the match. And resultingly, Quetta Gladiators have defended a total that looked severly below par, especially when McCullum and Roy walked out to open. And at 34/0 inside the third over, you could have sensed an easy chase, until Babar struck to send Roy back. Left-arm spinners then took over, sharing six wickets between them to conspire a mid-innings collapse from 34/0 to 77/6. Grant Elliott was dropped on 7 by Shehzad, but he was undone by Mohammad Nawaz on 30 on a slow, sluggish track - a moment that turned out to be defining.",Quetta Gladiators won by 8 runs,T20,Lahore Qalandars vs Quetta Gladiators,4
"Playing two matches within 24 hours is never easy, but it does give you a chance to redeem. Peshawar Zalmi lost after posting 190 odd last night, and have managed to win this with relative ease. They had lost two wickets inside two overs, with Sohail and Amir generating theatrical swing and seam. Malan and Morgan fought through that, then through tight uber-spells from Abrar Ahmed and Imad Wasim, and managed to forge a stand that kept Peshawar afloat. Morgan found his groove progressively, stroking 80 off 57 through Malik's expensive spell of 0/41 to take his side home with 9 balls to spare.",Peshawar Zalmi won by 7 wkts,T20,Karachi Kings vs Peshawar Zalmi,3
"What an incredible performance from the Southern Stars. They recovered from a sluggish start and posted a good total on the board. And later during their bowling, after New Zealand had got to a good start, managed to regroup and choke the run-flow. Regular wickets ensured that the White Ferns' innings never took the pace and in the end it seemed all too easy for the hosts.",Australia Women won by 40 runs, T20,Australia Women vs New Zealand Women,3
The Southern Stars' nightmare comes to an end. The chase started off with a run-out and ended with a run-out. In between was some very poor strokeplay from the Australian batters. They lost half their side with the score reading just nine. The seamers Tahuhu and Huddleston were brilliant with the new ball picking up two wickets each. Then the White Ferns' spinners never allowed their opposition to get back into the game. A 47-run win is a mammoth victory in T20s.,New Zealand Women won by 47 runs, T20,Australia Women vs New Zealand Women,3
"Felt like an easy win but it's been achieved in the last over. Quetta Gladiators win two in two, and Karachi Kings lose two in two. 159 always looked 20 runs short and so it proved to be. Despite two wickets by Sohail Khan in the third over, Rilee Rossouw rallied on, stitching a 130-run stand with Sarfraz off 90 balls. Karachi needed more wickets upfront but Sohail Khan's the only one who struck in the match for them.",Quetta Gladiators won by 7 wkts,T20,Quetta Gladiators vs Karachi Kings,3
"This has been surreal. You expected an easy chase with the target being 60. Not to be. McCullum was audacious with his captaincy, employing two slips, two gullies and even a short leg at times, phenomenally inspiring his bowlers, so much so that Yasir Shah finished with figures of 4-0-7-4. Peshawar started looking completely incapacitated to score a run in the Narine-wrecked powerplay - ending it at 20/2 - and then the wickets started to tumble even more so. There were times when you thought McCullum could pull off a heist, especially after Morgan's wicket was a sheer slice of luck, but the total just wasn't enough. In hindsight, a total of 100 would have been match-winning.",Peshawar Zalmi won by 3 wkts,T20,Peshawar Zalmi vs Lahore Qalandars,3
"A chase that ebbed and flowed. Cameron Delport picked five boundaries off an Asghar over to kick-start the chase the McCullum-way. He was caught and bowled by Hasan Ali and that triggered a stunning collapse. Five wickets were lost in 11 balls for just 1 run. From 38/0 to 39/5 in an eye-blink. Then a Hafeez delivery spun the other way, taking out Rizwan too and all looked lost. Yamin and Narine put up a quick-fire 45-run stand for the seventh wicket but the run-rate kept creeping up, despite their heroics, gradually shoving Lahore to the brink of a loss.",Peshawar Zalmi won by 17 runs,T20,Peshawar Zalmi vs Lahore Qalandars,2
"T20 cricket and its tricks. You just have to give it for the format. Today seemed to be a day destined for panic attacks. What a day of cricket we've had. Quetta were cruising after KP and Shehzad engineered a near match-winning 139-run stand for the second wicket, but some illogical tactics from Quetta twinned with some terrific bowling from Islamabad United meant the latter pulled off a heart-stopper. There's no room for complacency. Not in cricket, not in life. Period!",Islamabad United won by 1 run,T20,Quetta Gladiators vs Islamabad United,4
"What a great match. And that's what context does. Karachi had a lot riding on this win - a loss would have shoved them out of the tournament but Pollard's 20-ball 45 has managed to assuage the embarrassment off three panic-ridden run-outs in the innings. McCullum used as many as eight bowlers, including himself but Pollard was plain unstoppable in the end. 28 was nneded off the last 2 overs and they get their off the last over. Only few things in life are more dramatic. Pollard's innings couldn't be more different to Babar Azam's, which was about timing and placement, but both twinned together to really give it their all for Karachi. What a game, again.",Karachi Kings won by 5 wkts,T20,Lahore Qalandars vs Karachi Kings,4
"Wasim Akram and Deano are all pumped up. Misbah has a big grin on his face. In the first game more than 400 runs were scored, a total of 200 was chased down with an over to spare and here we are witnessing a nail-biting bonzer of a contest. Chasing 137, Islamabad United found their way to break out of the jail. Credit to fast bowlers from both sides, who made this encounter lively. Barring Smith, there was only one batsman who touched 30. Watto it was. Smith too struggled, but once he found his touch, there was no stopping. Just when they seemed cruising, Wahab Riaz and Hasan Ali bowled their hearts out to make it an edge-of-the-seat encounter. But to defend 6 off the final over is too hard a task",Islamabad United won by 5 wkts,T20,Islamabad United vs Peshawar Zalmi,4
"How did Peshawar Zalmi lose this? Hafeez and Malan put on 139 for the third wicket, which happens to be the highest ever in PSL. Tymal Mills was going through one of this bad spells, spraying deliveries down leg to add to his team's miseries. All looked done and dusted until Nawaz had Hafeez caught in the deep. Malan followed suit eight balls later, falling to Mills, but then Afridi exploded. 35 off only 13 balls that saw one boundary and four big - really big! - sixes. Just 8 off 7 balls were needed then, a win still looked imminent, when Nawaz was handed the ball, much to everyone's surprise. Three wickets fell in the last over. Sammy denied a single first ball, a catch fell short of Mills off the second, an inside-edge off the third. 2 off 3 needed. Then two wickets off two balls. 2 off 1 needed. A super over is possible. Definitely. But guess what, it was another run-out, driven by panic. And thus, another match was lost to nerves.",Quetta Gladiators won by 1 run, T20,Peshawar Zalmi vs Quetta Gladiators,5
"This was expected to be a stroll in the park for Islamabad United as it was for them in the previous edition. It wasn't this time around. Chasing a below-par score of 127, Islamabad didn't get off to an auspicious start. They lost the recently retired Dwayne Smith and Haddin to Amir in the third over and didn't quite recover from there. There was a mini partnership between Misbah and Asif Ali for the third wicket. Once that was broken by Imad Wasim, it was all one-way traffic. The spin duo of Wasim and Usama Mir squeezed the flow of runs picking up regular wickets, and their combined figures of 6/42 proved to be the difference. Amir and Sohail came back to wrap up the tail. ",Karachi Kings won by 44 runs, T20,Islamabad United vs Karachi Kings,2
"Darren Sammy's force take off. They sprint across the circumference to acknowledge the support from this housefull crowd. Karachi Kings, who lost 4 wickets inside 9 overs, were always behind the eight ball. The run rate kept mounting as Gayle struggled to find rhythm. Once Pollard came out to the middle, Gayle found his mojo and that was the only phase where Kings threatened to dominate. Wahab Riaz dismissed both at crucial junctures of the game making Imad Wasim's cameo negligible. Kamran Akmal's sparkling ton was well backed up by the Zalmi's bowlers. Wahab Riaz and Chris Jordan, in particular who bagged 3 wickets apiece",Peshawar Zalmi won by 24 runs, T20,Peshawar Zalmi vs Karachi Kings,3
"When 4 of your top 6 batsmen get out without reaching double digits, you don't deserve to win. Not a final at least. Peshawar Zalmi's strength has been bowling all throughout the season and this win will stand as a testimony for why they have been crowned champions. The pitch got a little better for bowling in the second half, but when you lose half the side inside 8 overs, it's tough to make a comeback. Also Quetta had 4 new foreign players which didn't help their cause. Apart from Sarfraz and Sean Ervine no-one got going, surrendering meekly with 21 balls to spare. Wasn't a fitting final, but cricket won, Pakistan cricket won and all THAT build-up leading into the game came out trumps. Hang on for the most important moments of the season.",Peshawar Zalmi won by 58 runs,T20,Quetta Gladiators vs Peshawar Zalmi,2
"Before we get into anything else, just take a moment to applaud the death bowling from Sunrisers Hyderabad. Bhuvi was absolutely brilliant there to kill the game off towards the end along with Nehra. To be fair, RCB were a long way off and needed 69 with only five overs left. But the Indian pace duo absolutely shut the door on them. Rashid Khan bowled well on IPL debut too, picking up two crucial wickets as well. Chasing 208, RCB had got off to a decent start through Gayle and Mandeep, but neither of those two could kick on. In fact, all of their top five batsmen scored over 20 but just couldn't get that substantial score to win the game. All in all, a solid showing from the defending champions.",Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 35 runs, T20,Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore,3
"There was always an inevitability to the game. Pune were always going to get home if Smith stayed the course. Bumrah's penultimate over threatened to reverse that script. He left Pollard with 13 in the bank. Nerves would have certainly jangled as the final over began with just 3 singles. However, how dare anybody ever doubt what the Aussie, and now, Pune skipper can do. With 10 needed in 3 balls, Smith clobbered a couple of sixes to seal the win. They should have got home much earlier after a flying start from Rahane and his partnership with Smith which set the game up beautifully. Stokes chipped in with a useful cameo in the middle too. Mumbai fought back after that but Smith stood firmly in the way. They weren't getting one over him tonight.",Rising Pune Supergiant won by 7 wkts, T20,Rising Pune Supergiant vs Mumbai Indians,3
"A royal shellacking for the Gujarat Lions! My word, did we see a show tonight?! Lynn and Gambhir made a complete mockery of the total of 183 and chased it down with 31 balls to spare. Theirs is the highest partnership for KKR in the IPL. What a masterstroke to send Lynn at the top of the order. He sent shockwaves through the bowling attack in the powerplay and Gujarat didn't have it in them to recover. Even Gambhir. You'd think that with all the carnage at the other end, Gambhir would have gone under the radar. But the KKR skipper completely held his own and got himself going with some stunning shots. Gujarat clearly lack quality in that bowling attack. Apart from Praveen Kumar, who is a class apart, there's absolutely no one the skipper can rely upon when the going gets tough. Some serious thinking to be done as to what combination they field from now on..",Kolkata Knight Riders won by 10 wkts, T20,Gujarat Lions vs Kolkata Knight Riders,3
"What a game we've had here in Bangalore. RCB appeared to be short by 20-25 runs at the halfway stage but their bowlers stepped it up tonight. What stood out was that they looked for wickets right through. The quicks were intense, the spinners were aggressive and DD just kept faltering along the way. You've got to feel for Rishabh Pant who fought so valiantly out there and was waging a lone battle in the second half of that chase. He's certainly one to watch out for. Chahal and Watson were brilliant under pressure though. The scoreboard clearly reflects how Delhi's middle order completely buckled when subjected to the cauldron of the Chinnaswamy. Only four DD players managed to get into double digits. Their batting depth had evoked a lot of concern going into this campaign and this result highlighted it further.",Royal Challengers Bangalore won by 15 runs, T20,Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Delhi Daredevils,4
"Nitish Rana and Hardik Pandya have pulled off a coup at the Wankhede. Mumbai looked to be gone after Pollard was dismissed and they still had to get 49 from 3 overs. But a scintillating fifty from Nitish Rana followed by a blinding cameo from Hardik Pandya has scripted the improbable. KKR will look back at those fielding errors in the final over. They couldn't have timed those errors any worse. Things could have been so different. But take nothing away from what we've witnessed here tonight. A special, special victory from out of nowhere.",Mumbai Indians won by 4 wkts,T20,Mumbai Indians vs Kolkata Knight Riders,4
"So, where did it go wrong for RCB? Watson won toss and opted to bat, lost 3 wickets inside the powerplay. If not for ABD, they would have been left embarrassing with a paltry total. He came out, stayed ahead of the game, and ensured he was there till the end. Scored 89 off 46, and the rest 55 off 74. I think that's where the game was lost. Striking under 100 in T20s is almost an unacceptable crime. RCB did commit and paid hefty. The chase wasn't a typical hustle-bustle approach from KXIP. Not until Maxi came and forced things. The ever-reliable Amla struck a fifty to make things more memorable.",Kings XI Punjab won by 8 wkts,T20,Kings XI Punjab vs Royal Challengers Bangalore,3
"This is Mumbai's yard, the Wankhede. They have one of the better home records in IPL cricket, and this performance goes on to show why. Sunrisers have now lost all three matches they've played here. Right from the top-down, they never got going. Warner and Dhawan may have put up a fifty-run opening stand but Mumbai still maintained good control and never let things slip. That pressure manifested in SRH's collapse from 105/1 to 158/8. A target of 159 was never going to be enough at this venue, especially with the dew. Rashid and Bhuvneshwar stood out once more but a few good cameos from Parthiv, Krunal and Rana is all it took for Mumbai to cruise home.",Mumbai Indians won by 4 wkts,T20,Mumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad,3
"The owners are happy and so are the players. It's been a thrilling night of cricket. After Andrew James TYE-D RPS with a hat-trick, and an eventual fifer, it was always tough to plot a comeback. They were off to a blazing start, but Smith's untimely wicket exposed the vulnerability in the middle order. Tiwary and Ankit slogged a few, but against the likes of B-MAC, Smith and Finch it was never going to be enough. As Steven Smith reckons in the post-match presentation they ""were 20 runs short."" RPS revamped their bowling line-up for this game, but there's no change in fortunes. Their bowlers were left clueless with GL batsmen going crash-bang-wallop from ball one...",Gujarat Lions won by 7 wkts,T20,Gujarat Lions vs Rising Pune Supergiant,4
"During the innings break, Uthappa mentioned that the pitch would play better batting second. That, however, didn't seem to be the case though as SRH struggled to find boundaries in the first 6 overs. Things didn't improve much after the powerplay either. They seemed okay with Warner and Dhawan showing some willingness to engineer a solid foundation at the top. But, once the spinners arrived, they were tied down with some terrific accuracy which led to the stem of run-flow, inserting extra pressure on the batsmen to follow. Yuvi did exhibit a glitter of his class, but it didn't last long. Overall, they lost by 17 runs on a track where Uthappa scored 68 off 39. Just saying. Period!",Kolkata Knight Riders won by 17 runs,T20,Kolkata Knight Riders vs Sunrisers Hyderabad,3
"A comprehensive win for Zaheer and his lads. Once Corey Anderson produced the big finish to take DD to 188, KXIP were always up against it. It was a score which has never been chased down here, right through the history of IPL. Punjab needed a good start with the bat. But Shahbaz Nadeem ensured that the visitors were always playing catch up as he struck in consecutive overs in powerplay. Morgan looked good but he found the fielder at the wrong time. Miller struggled right through and the rate shot up beyond 12 even before Maxi came to the crease. It was too much pressure against a quality attack. The deal was sealed when Mishra dismissed the Punjab skipper for a duck. Axar Patel played a good little knock towards the end but it was always going to be in a losing cause.",Delhi Daredevils won by 51 runs,T20,Delhi Daredevils vs Kings XI Punjab,3
"Absolutely brilliant performance from the RPS bowlers. They read the conditions beautifully and found a method to strangle the opposition. The ploy was to bowl slower back of length deliveries right into the pitch and the RCB batsmen just couldn't find a counter to it. The home side had initially got off to a decent start against the new ball which was coming on much better. That's where a lot of credit must go to Tahir for changing the course of the game and building pressure with a brilliant spell which included the wicket of AB de Villiers. Stokes chipped in with timely wickets of Kohli and Watson. And Unadkat and Thakur, who might have been the major worries going into this, stepped up magnificently at the death on a pitch which was slowing rapidly.",Rising Pune Supergiant won by 27 runs,T20,Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Rising Pune Supergiant,3
"Bloody hell, what a game! Manan Vohra played the knock of his life to turn the game around just when it seemed buried and nearly pulled off a single-handed heist. But after playing a magical innings and with the finish line within sight, he faltered off a low full toss. To say that he didn't deserve to be on the losing side would be an understatement. On the flip side, Bhuvneshwar Kumar definitely deserved to be on the winning side. The execution under pressure from the medium pacer, who is racking up the wickets in this IPL, was phenomenal. It really came down to Bhuvneshwar vs Vohra in that penultimate over, and that's where the battle was decided.",Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 5 runs,T20,Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Kings XI Punjab,5
"RCB win, finally. And away from home, coming on the back of three consecutive defeats, and do so on a day when AB de Villiers succumbed to his perennial back injury, yet again. The game was set by a high first innings score. Gayle went berserk at the top, Kohli played the nurdler, and then Kedar took over. A 16-ball 38 that took the score past 200, and perhaps the game beyond Gujarat, despite McCullum keeping them alive for most parts of this chase. Raina was all grace, but had a stint too short win a game. Ishan Kishan's 39 off 16 seemed delayed by all that was ahead of him, and this innings screamed for a rank higher up the order. Next game maybe, Ishan. Maybe. There's a long waiting line in front, remember?",Royal Challengers Bangalore won by 21 runs,T20,Gujarat Lions vs Royal Challengers Bangalore,4
"DD were in a comfortable position at the end of 9 overs. What followed was quite dramatic. An over from Yuvraj Singh turned things around in SRH's favour, but the chase never seemed out of reach. Shreyas Iyer was striking it at 160ks and all he needed was an able ally at the other end. Guess that's what went missing tonight. Also, the execution of death bowling from Sunrisers was terrific. Siddarth Kaul, the hero a couple of nights ago, yet again justified Warner's decision and held his nerve to complete the formalities.",Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 15 runs,T20,Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Delhi Daredevils,3
"Gujarat were off to a flier from Finch and McCullum. But that rain interruption at the five-over mark threatened to derail their run-chase completely as KKR started off really strong after the resumption. That's when Raina stepped up to the plate. Despite wickets tumbling around him, the Gujarat skipper played a magnificent knock to propel his team to the door of victory. He steered the chase almost single-handedly during that middle period, getting boundaries at regular intervals to ease the pressure of the run-rate. He finally found some support from Jadeja and their partnership sealed the game for the visitors. The bowlers for KKR, who are usually really good at home, had an off-day with most of them, barring Kuldeep Yadav, taking a beating.",Gujarat Lions won by 4 wkts,T20,Kolkata Knight Riders vs Gujarat Lions,4
"There's a reason why they say that great players can never be written off. MS Dhoni's painful struggles in this IPL have caused a lot of concern, but when it came down to it, the champion batsman turned it on in style. It's not for nothing that he's known as one of the best finishers in our game. He took some time to find his stride, but when he went into overdrive, even SRH's best bowler in Bhuvneshwar had no answers. At one stage, around the 16th over mark, it looked as if Dhoni had left it too late. But it's never too late with Dhoni. We've seen it all these years. We should have seen it coming today too. What a fantastic knock.",Rising Pune Supergiant won by 6 wkts,T20,Rising Pune Supergiant vs Sunrisers Hyderabad,4
"It started on a shaky note for Gujarat when McCullum missed a full toss. Raina and Finch had done well to steady the ship for a while when the storm struck. Cariappa's two in two in the middle of the chase almost shut the doors on the hosts. From 95/3 to 102/6, it all happened too quickly. So quickly that Dinesh Karthik never got the time to think his strategies. Punjab's death bowling had been a concern so far in the tournament but today things were a bit different. The slower balls were sent down the right line making shot-making too tough for the Gujarat batsmen. The loss means that Gujarat continue to be the bottom dwellers in the table.",Kings XI Punjab won by 26 runs,T20,Gujarat Lions vs Kings XI Punjab,3
"Well, would you believe it? A batting lineup comprising of Gayle, Kohli, AB de Villiers has been shot out for the lowest IPL score ever. Not one batsman managed to get into double digits. At the halfway stage, it looked like RCB had done pretty well to keep KKR down to 131. But KKR were just unstoppable with the ball. Nathan Coulter-Nile proved too hot to handle and ripped the game right open with a quick 3-fer. Then the way Woakes nipped the ball around, he might have well been bowling in England. RCB just couldn't handle the pressure and were blown away by the storm created by this full-house and the collective fire of NCN, Woakes, Umesh and de Grandhomme on a pitch which had definitely freshened up with the little evening sprinkle.",Kolkata Knight Riders won by 82 runs,T20,Kolkata Knight Riders vs Royal Challengers Bangalore,3
"Another disappointing batting performance from RCB. Their top-order caved once more and that momentum was never reversed. 134 would have taken some defending here, even with the tacky nature of the pitch. Samuel Badree gave some hope by getting rid of both GL openers cheaply, but it was snuffed out pretty quickly by a rampaging Finch who played at a different level and smoked a half-century in just 22 balls on a pitch where most batsmen struggled. Raina tagged along playing an unusually scratchy knock, probably jolted by the little bump he took on the shoulder in the field. But he managed to find his fluency towards the end and closed the game off. A comprehensive win for GL in the end. As for RCB, they can only get to seven wins at best. They might be out of the race already, barring something really spectacular.",Gujarat Lions won by 7 wkts,T20,Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Gujarat Lions,4
"KKR solidify their position at the top of the table with another clinical showing. Their bowlers did extremely well to pull things back at the death of the first innings by taking wickets, after DD were primed for a big finish. And then Uthappa and Gambhir ensured another comfortable run-chase with a significant second-wicket partnership. They really like batting together, those two. Zaheer Khan pulled his hamstring early in the piece which didn't help. The killer blow came when Uthappa was dropped early in his innings. At that time, Rabada was in full steam having just cleaned up Narine. There's no telling how different things could have been had that chance been gobbled. But there was no looking back from that point on. Uthappa went on to notch his fourth half-century this season, playing another majestic innings to take the game away at the rate of knots. DD, meanwhile, have slipped to their fourth consecutive loss.",Kolkata Knight Riders won by 7 wkts,T20,Kolkata Knight Riders vs Delhi Daredevils,4
"The trio of Dhawan, Warner and Williamson set things up with the bat, and the bowlers did enough to overcome a valiant effort from Shaun Marsh to seal the win. Rashid Khan and Bhuvneshwar Kumar were brilliant once again, registering superb figures in a game where stopping runs proved to be difficult on a belter of a pitch. At no stage during the chase did it feel like SRH were not in control, which can be credited to Rashid's spell which ensured that the required rate shot up over 14 with six overs still left. Even at his best, Marsh wasn't able to take the attack to the Afghanistan leggie as he just didn't pick him most of the time. He upped the ante later on but it was too much to do for a lone man. Nothing much of note from the Kings XI other than Marsh's effort, and maybe Guptill's little burst at the top. SRH register their first away win of the season.",Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 26 runs,T20,Kings XI Punjab vs Sunrisers Hyderabad,3
"Handshakes all round. Guptill pumps his fists in delight. The entire Kings XI Punjab are up on their feet and all smiles in the dug-out. They have made a mockery of this chase. An absolute thrashing. Delhi hardly had anything on the board. A score of 67 in a T20 match, even though the pitch was aiding the bowlers, was never going to be enough. This was an annihilation. As comprehensive as it gets. Guptill never gave a whiff, came out all guns blazing and reached his fifty in style. Amla played the anchors role and the hosts wolfed down the target with 73 balls to spare.",Kings XI Punjab won by 10 wkts,T20,Kings XI Punjab vs Delhi Daredevils,3
"A perfect game for the hosts. And coming on a day when even rains failed to play spoilsport. And if you ask me, all they did was to puncture a chase when Manish Pandey and Robin Uthappa were going strong. Not quite as strong as nailing the run-chase - definitely not! - but KKR had hope then. Once Uthappa fell, being brilliantly hoodwinked by Siraj's pace, or the lack of it, the innings stuttered. And so did KKR, losing for the first time in six games while chasing. A word of praise for Kaul, who brilliantly scalped Gambhir up front, and so brilliantly that it ruffled Uthappa's feathers, triggering him into a little spat that Yuvraj didn't like. Well, of course.",Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 48 runs,T20,Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Kolkata Knight Riders,3
"Now this is a stunning win, recovering from the shambles of 10/3, and then 42/4. Sangwan had a pretty comeback, striking twice in his first over and sending a tizzy down Pune's spine early in the game. What stood out was the pace and bounce he extracted, getting Steven Smith out with a top-edged pull. Should suggest a lot, given Umesh and Shami and Ishant tried all winter long. Ben Stokes walked in ahead of Dhoni, and outlived him at the crease, bruting a stunning 103 off 63 balls to take his side home. Thampi threatened to turn the tables around, when he scalped Dhoni with a slower ball in the seventeenth over. Pune looked done there, because Dhoni had consumed 33 balls for his 26, but Stokes took over brilliantly, unleashing at the right time. Thampi's last over quite ironically conceded 17 runs, which had two sixes from Stokes, and that changed the game. Just eight runs were needed from six, and bam, Pune were over the line.",Rising Pune Supergiant won by 5 wkts,T20,Rising Pune Supergiant vs Gujarat Lions,5
"Delhi win! And Delhi win contrary to popular opinion. The opinion which gained force after the first innings was over. 185 was a good score considering how the ball was holding up at the fag end of Hyderabad's innings. But the hosts got the start that is needed to take these kind of totals down. Samson was fluent as ever and finally captain Nair too found a few off the middle of the bat. Shreyas Iyer batted in his usual manner and Corey Anderson came good after ages. Delhi's batting efforts were helped by some predictable bowling from Hyderabad. The bowlers were generally short and bowled too many slower deliveries. This could have been over much early had the batters not missed out one some juicy full tosses. Nonetheless, a sweet win for Delhi. Hyderabad, on the other hand, lose another away-game.",Delhi Daredevils won by 6 wkts,T20,Delhi Daredevils vs Sunrisers Hyderabad,3
"Handshakes all around! Steve Smith, obviously, the happiest. He has every reason to be so. KKR were always behind the eight ball. Agreed chasing is their strength, but they cannot be drooling over that fact and forget winning matches when they bat first. Their batting hasn't quite fired, with Uthappa's absence clearly felt throughout.",Rising Pune Supergiant won by 4 wkts,T20,Kolkata Knight Riders vs Rising Pune Supergiant,2
"When Raina was dropped thrice in the first innings, thoughts of Delhi winning weren't fashionable. And they assumed impossible proportions when opener Karun Nair, also the captain, edged an upper-cut to the keeper, getting himself into an embarrassing tangle. But what followed was perhaps Dravid: Rishabh Pant came out to bat at No.3. He missed his first ball, picking it off his pads but that was it for the night. 6 fours and 9 sixes followed in a stunning partnership with Sanju Samson, that connived not only Delhi's highest chase that's also the highest at Kotla, and the second-highest in the IPL ever, but also dumped Gujarat Lions out of IPL 2017. A target of 209 tonight wasn't enough -- what's the day today, eh?",Delhi Daredevils won by 7 wkts,T20,Delhi Daredevils vs Gujarat Lions,4
"""Disheartening"" is the word Kohli used at the start of his post-match talk. That sums it up. The fans turned out in great numbers. They know RCB have no chance of qualifying. They know no-one had a great season with the bat. After the first half, however, the stadium had a bit of positivity oozing around as RCB needed 139 to win. A batting line-up that boasts of Kohli, ABD and Gayle. All three charged out to Sandeep Sharma and sold their wickets. After that it has been all downhill. The batting collapse, lesser described, the better. For KXIP, they now have to win at least 3 out of their 4 remaining games to have a hope of finishing in the top four.",Kings XI Punjab won by 19 runs,T20,Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Kings XI Punjab,2
"What a night for Mumbai. They have qualified for the play-offs. Played like table toppers. First put a mountain on the board and then crushed the opponents under the weight of the total. The chase was always going to be tough, like Harsha Bhogle said after the first innings. But even an ardent Mumbai fan would not have thought that this will turn out to be such an easy affair. Samson departed first ball and when Pant left without troubling the scorers, the door had almost shut on the hosts. This loss makes things really difficult for Delhi. They now no more are the controllers of their fate as their progress in the tournament will depend on whether or not others peform horrendously.",Mumbai Indians won by 146 runs,T20,Delhi Daredevils vs Mumbai Indians,3
"Another humbling defeat for RCB. Head's maiden fifty had given them respectability on what was another sluggish Chinnaswamy wicket, but there was nothing sluggish about what followed. Whether that little bit of rain during the first innings quickened the wicket is up for debate, but Narine and Lynn absolutely smoked the bejeezus out of the bowling. It was the ultimate thrill-ride if batsmen going bonkers is how you like your T20 cricket. Quite stunningly, as destructive as Lynn was, Narine managed to upstage him with the joint fastest fifty in IPL history, coming off just 15 balls. Spare a thought for the RCB. They must have thought that the worst was behind them. Now it is.",Kolkata Knight Riders won by 6 wkts,T20,Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Kolkata Knight Riders,4
"What has Amla done to deserve this? Both his centuries this season have ended up on the losing side. Punjab looked short on intent tonight. Sandeep's round the wicket fiasco killed the momentum, if there was any. And from there on started the slide that had everything disastrous - dropped catches, overthrows. This loss makes things a little difficult for Punjab who would have hoped to get close to Hyderabad in the points table.",Gujarat Lions won by 6 wkts,T20,Kings XI Punjab vs Gujarat Lions,2
"Now how did Punjab manage to haul this back in? A Narine and Lynn show - another one, yes - had popped the powerplay score to 61/1. It all looked set for Kolkata. They were off to an uber good start and chasing on a ground where dew normally arrives to hasten chases. But it didn't, tonight. And it meant that the spinners, Tewatia and Axar could bowl in tandem, choking the runs in the middle overs. Pacers had leaked runs up front, so when Sandeep came in to bowl the sixteenth over, taking over from Tewatia, there were concerns. But they soon waned into oblivion, as Sandeep and then particularly Mohit bowled yorkers, changed pace cleverly and choked KKR completely.",Kings XI Punjab won by 14 runs,T20,Kings XI Punjab vs Kolkata Knight Riders,4
"Phew! What a game of cricket. Handshakes all-round. Agony for Mumbai, ecstasy for Punjab. Sensational comeback by the hosts, but couldn't quite cross the finish line. Chasing 231 was always going to be an arduous task. They were off to a blazing start, Parthiv and Simmons plundered the bowlers to all parts of the ground. They were coasting all well and kept things under control. However, Punjab clawed back by removing both openers in quick succession. From there, Mumbai continued to lose wickets in clusters. All batsmen came in and got starts but none could convert them into a big score. Pollard and Pandya kept the belief in the MI camp with their big hitting but in the end, the ever-mounting run rate proved to be the demon and devoured the hosts. Thanks to some brilliant death bowling from Mohit Sharma and Sandeep Sharma. ",Kings XI Punjab won by 7 runs,T20,Mumbai Indians vs Kings XI Punjab,5
"So Pune have made things a little more interesting as the race for the playoffs heats up. They are still in a pretty strong position, but don't have a 'Q' next to them in the table yet. 168 was a decent score on this pitch, but it was a total where the chasing team was never really out of the chase. The partnership which Manoj Tiwary and Ben Stokes had got going through the middle had in fact given Pune the upper hand. But Stokes's dismissal off a full toss turned the game around. Dhoni uncharacteristically faltered in game awareness and got run out, and the momentum of those couple of quick wickets enabled Delhi to turn things around and finish strongly.",Delhi Daredevils won by 7 runs,T20,Delhi Daredevils won by 7 runs,5
"Where did this change? You don't need to be a rocket scientist to know that. The first half of the first innings was all about Gujarat, they were rampaging through SRH bowling like a wild horse and then they ran out of steam. As if the blinkers blinded them. The chariot crashed and never recovered. They did make a momentary comeback when SRH started the chase but Warner came in their way. The Hyderabad skipper found a sensible partner in Vijay Shankar, who displayed icy cool nerves and nudged around with the senior man to see this one through.",Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 8 wkts,T20,Gujarat Lions vs Sunrisers Hyderabad,3
" Where did the game change? Two inflection points: First when Dhoni went berserk with his barrage of sixes, and then when Washington Sundar picked three wickets in two overs of his. So Pune had the momentum on either side of the innings break, and how beautifully did they ride the wave! Mumbai were caught unawares at home against their neighbours who seem to have the wood over them. Three games against Pune this season for Mumbai, and they have lost all three.",Rising Pune Supergiant won by 20 runs, T20,Mumbai Indians vs Rising Pune Supergiant,4
"The much anticipated Bengaluru rains didn't turn up tonight, KKR didn't either. Mumbai Indians continue to remain their nemesis, their bogey team. But full marks to Mumbai. The intensity with which they approached the game and set the field on fire with the ball was something to behold. Some intelligent field placements - getting Lynn like that. Some inspired selections - sticking with Karn over Harbhajan, which eventually proved to be the gamechanger. And some excellent execution. It all boiled down to the horrendous start that KKR had. They lost their footing early on with wickets tumbling everywhere, and were never able to really gain that ground back. Jaggi and Suryakumar led some sort of a recovery, but just when they threatened to take KKR to a score, Mumbai struck back again and closed the innings off for 107. That was never going to be enough, not even with Piyush Chawla bowling the way he did, and not even with Chinnaswamy's sluggish pitch.",Mumbai Indians won by 6 wkts, T20,Mumbai Indians vs Kolkata Knight Riders,4
"So a game that totally makes up for the one-dimensionality of the first game. The target of 155 set by Rajshahi Kings did feel below par on first sighting, given the arduous task of defending with dew on the other side. Kings' bowlers started well actually. Adam Lyth was picked up by Mehidy Hasan in the first over itself while the other opener, Johnson Charles, was pinned in front by Farhad Reza in the fourth. Solid contributions from Mohammad Mithun (46 from 33) and Shahriar Nafees (35 from 34) kept Rangpur in the game, setting the stage for Ravi Bopara and Thisara Perera to seal it in the end with increasing ease.",Rangpur Riders won by 6 wkts, T20,Rajshahi Kings vs Rangpur Riders,3
"Sylhet spoiled things as the match approach its end and had to sweat hard in the end to register their second win. After Tharanga and Fletcher provided a prolific starts, it appeared to be a cakewalk of sorts for them. But some superb spin show from Nabi and Rashid Khan checked the runs in the middle overs to tighten the equation. However, in the end it turned out to be another great day for Sylhet who have now gained an unstoppable momentum.",Sylhet Sixers won by 4 wkts, T20,Sylhet Sixers vs Comilla Victorians,3
"A comprehensive victory for Dhaka Dynamites. Chasing a huge score, Khulna didn't get off to an auspicious start as they lost two early wickets. Walton, though kept going after the bowlers and played one shot too many. He perished for a 13-ball 30 to Shakib. Mahmudullah and Rossouw were dismissed in quick succession and the game was almost sealed there. Khaled Ahmed, on debut, took two wickets and reduced Khulna to 88-7. That's when Archer was joined by Mosharraf Hossain at the crease and together they added 40 runs for the eighth wicket with the former top-scoring with 36. Narine picked two wickets in the end to finish the formalities. Earlier in the evening, Delport and Lewis were involved in a century partnership which helped the Dynamites post a mammoth score of 202.",Dhaka Dynamites won by 65 runs, T20,Khulna Titans vs Dhaka Dynamites,3
"A walk in the park for Rajshahi Kings. After reducing the Riders to a below-par score of 134 on a slowish track, the batsmen didn't put a foot wrong. The Kings' openers - Simmons and Mominul - went after the bowling from the third over after getting their eye in. At the end of the powerplay, they were 48-0. Mortaza and Co. weren't effective with the ball and allowed both the openers to register their respective fifties. The 122-run stand was broken by Thisara Perera who picked two wickets within a span of 4 balls, but the damage was already done. The Kings won with 20 balls to spare.",Rajshahi Kings won by 8 wkts,T20,Rangpur Riders vs Rajshahi Kings,4
"Wow! The table toppers have been massacred by the home team. Just imagine what would have been their case if Sylhet's final pair had not added those 40+ runs. Chasing a below-par score, DD sent out two of their most powerful strikers to open the innings. Afridi went BOOM BOOM straightaway and Lewis joined the party. They raced away to 59 - more than 50% of the target - in four overs. Bresnan struck twice in two balls, but that was the only teeny-tiny phase in the match where the visitors found success (or did they?). Shakib joined Lewis and together they blew apart the Sylhet bowlers. In total, eleven sixes were hit in the innings.",Dhaka Dynamites won by 8 wkts,T20,Dhaka Dynamites vs Sylhet Sixers,3
"A comprehensive win for Khulna Titans after posting an above-par score of 170. The Vikings lost their top four inside five overs. And from there, it was always going to be a tough task for them. Misbah was joined by Raza and they added 49 runs, the latter being the aggressor. Misbah couldn't find his timing and was dismissed for 30 with his strike rate around 80. Reece and Hayder played their shots in the end, but there was no way Chittagong could go past the finishing line.",Khulna Titans won by 18 runs,T20,Chittagong Vikings vs Khulna Titans,3
"The victorians fluffed in the first seven overs, losing both openers and scoring under six, but once Imrul Kayes and Buttler got together there was a spring in the step. The duo injected the much-needed momentum with some clean ball striking and had the asking rate under their grasp. Both fell out looking for biggies, but Samuels 8-ball 17 was the perfect cameo they needed to complete what has been a magnificent night for them. And thus, with this victory they leap to second in the points table.",Comilla Victorians won by 6 wkts,T20,Comilla Victorians vs Chittagong Vikings,3
"A comfortable run-chase from the Rajshahi Kings, sweeping off Sylhet's challenge of 147 without too much bother. The pitch was too good, and the target too small. Once that opening partnership between Mominul Haque and Rony Talukdar found some rhythm, it became very difficult for Sylhet to pull things back. They did fight back with three quick wickets, but Zakir Hasan's quickfire half-century killed them off.",Rajshahi Kings won by 7 wkts,T20,Rajshahi Kings vs Sylhet Sixers,3
"There were a few crests and troughs in the Khulna innings. But that was until Mahmudullah and Ariful Haque got together. The duo took their time early on and didn't panic, even with the required rate touching nine. Then, to ease the pressure, Ariful unleashed a couple of smashing blows and turned it in Khulna's favour. That almost sealed the game. Mahmudullah did the rest by taking his team home along with Brathwaite who gave a striking glimpse of his power in just the two balls that he faced.",Khulna Titans won by 5 wkts,T20,Khulna Titans vs Chittagong Vikings,3
"Dhaka solidify their position at the top of the table with a commanding performance. The two West Indians - Lewis and Pollard - set it up with blistering fifties with the bat, and then the bowlers hardly gave a sniff to Rajshahi, who were just not up for it today. Catches dropped in the field, toothless bowling, and some very lacklustre batting from them, after their win yesterday. So they continue to blow hot and cold this year.",Dhaka Dynamites won by 68 runs,T20,Dhaka Dynamites vs Rajshahi Kings,3
"Excellent bowling display from the Victorians' bowlers. 153 was a par-score and they were up against a strong batting line-up. Mahedi Hasan was superb upfront with the new ball and he should have had Gayle for a golden duck. But the umpire didn't rule it in his favour. Gayle, who got two lives, started to go after the bowlers and scored three boundaries in the same over. But, the big man was tamed by the Afghanistani sensation - Rashid Khan. The leg-break trapped him off the first ball (Hawk-Eye showed it to be pitching outside leg). The spinners struck in tandem and reduced the Riders to 32-4 in the sixth over. Mithun and Bopara played cautiously and were involved in a 67-run stand. However, both of them found it hard to time the ball. In the end, Hasan Ali was once again brilliant with his variations. Comilla climb up to the second spot with this win.",Comilla Victorians won by 14 runs,T20,Rangpur Riders vs Comilla Victorians,4
"Shoaib Malik kept his head calm and took his team past the finishing line. Chasing a below-par score, Tamim came all guns blazing. He played one shot too many and perished to Narine. Malik joined hands with Kayes and together they slowly steadied the ship. Bravo and Buttler got into the double digits and were dismissed. However, the Pakistani was unruffled. He sensibly saw off Narine and went after the less experienced bowlers. The Victorians, with this win, go to the top of the table pipping the Dynamites.",Comilla Victorians won by 4 wkts,T20,Dhaka Dynamites vs Comilla Victorians,4
"Much-needed win for Rangpur Riders. They will get out of the last position with this win. What a comeback from Mortaza's men! At 25-3, Nasir Hossain was joined by Sabbir Rahman and they went after the Riders' bowlers with a century stand. At the end of 16 overs, they were 135-3, needing 35 runs. The time-out was taken and the momentum shifted towards the Rangpur side - thanks to the 2-run over from captain Mortaza. Rubel and Thisara Perera held their nerve in the death and executed the yorkers superbly.",Rangpur Riders won by 7 runs,T20,Sylhet Sixers vs Rangpur Riders,5
"Ariful Haque has won it single-handedly for Khulna. Came pretty late in the innings, when his team was virtually out of the match. Sami was bowling some brilliant yorkers and it looked all but over for Khulna. But Haque kept his calm and managed 18 runs off the 18th over, Hossain Ali was the unlucky bowler. Once the equation was achievable, he ensured that he had the strike for the last over. Needed only two balls in the last over from Smith to seal the deal. Earlier it was a valiant effort from skipper Mahmudullah which had kept them in the game for most part of the innings before some late wickets brought Rajshahi back.",Khulna Titans won by 2 wkts,T20,Rajshahi Kings vs Khulna Titans,5
"Wow, what a finish! Dhaka have somehow managed to botch their run-chase spectacularly. No question they should have got home, and should have done so comfortably. However, first, Afridi allowed Rangpur an opening when he threw his wicket away with an ugly slog. That wicket stalled their momentum appreciably. And then in the last over, with 10 required, it appeared as if Pollard would go on to finish it off after he hit a giant six off the third ball. But now in hindsight, his decision to refuse three possible singles is what came back to bite him as Perera produced two sensational yorkers off the final two balls to help Rangpur pull off a heist.",Rangpur Riders won by 3 runs,T20,Dhaka Dynamites vs Rangpur Riders,4
"A big win for the hosts. The platform was set by the batters - thanks to Raza and Ronchi - who powered Chittagong to a massive score of 211. The Sixers came out all guns blazing with Gunathilaka starting off their innings with a six. The Sri Lankan perished early, but Andre Fletcher had other plans. The West Indian went after the bowlers and the match was nicely poised with 10 overs left. He ensured that the asking rate didn't swell above their reach. But, a slower ball from Taskin led to his downfall. That's when the Sixers lost their plot. Babar Azam struggled for timing and he fell for a 32-ball 41. Soumya Sarkar and Stiaan van Zyl chipped in with two wickets apiece, which ruled out a win for Sylhet.",Chittagong Vikings won by 40 runs,T20,Chittagong Vikings vs Sylhet Sixers,3
"After a scratchy start, the Riders found momentum through their skipper Mashrafe Mortaza who surprised everyone by promoting himself up the order and smashing a 17-ball 42. That set the foundation for the rest of the batters who managed to find occasional boundaries and ensured the asking rate was always under control. With 14 needing from the final over, Taskin Ahmed showed nerves and bowled some ordinary deliveries which helped Riders upset the home team and their vibrant crowd.",Rangpur Riders won by 3 wkts,T20,Chittagong Vikings vs Rangpur Riders,3
"And so, with this win, Dhaka Dynamites leap up to the top of the ladder. The chase lacked steam until the 8th over, but Evin Lewis unleashed himself soon scoring 26 runs - which included 4 sixes - off the next over. Denly played the second fiddle, but found a way to hit timely boundaries. That injected the much-needed momentum and although the visitors lost both the aforementioned batsmen, the task never got out of hand with the likes of Shakib and Delport chewing the target with yawning ease. Unfortunately, by virtue of this loss, Chittagong Vikings find themselves with no hope of qualifying for the play-offs.",Dhaka Dynamites won by 7 wkts,T20,Chittagong Vikings vs Dhaka Dynamites,3
"Could well be the end of the road for the Kings. A woeful performance from them. In all three departments. After conceding the highest score of the season, they had to bat out of their skins to record a believe-it-or-not win. Unfortunately, their batsmen couldn't find any rhythm and kept losing wickets at regular intervals, and thus, had to cope with a huge defeat of 68 runs in the end. The Titans, on the other hand, reclaim the top spot and displace Dhaka Dynamites who possess a better net run rate among all teams.",Khulna Titans won by 68 runs,T20,Khulna Titans vs Rajshahi Kings,2
"'Small totals are always tricky to chase.' That adage holds perfectly true for this game. The top four Victorians batsmen, chasing a meagre total, tried too hard for boundaries in the initial overs and couldn't quite get going given the two-paced nature of the pitch. They somehow laboured along with decent contributions from their senior three; Tamim, Malik and Samuels. Credit to the Riders' bowlers for making a good fist of challenging the opposition despite a shambolic show with the bat.",Comilla Victorians won by 4 wkts,T20,Comilla Victorians vs Rangpur Riders,5
"That brings an end to the league rounds. Comilla Victorians stamp their authority with yet another clinical win. They never allowed Sylhet to gain the momentum. Having scored a decent total, they always were in with their noses ahead. But the way their bowlers came charging, particularly Hasan Ali, it never allowed Sylhet to have a go at the target. Liton Das is adjudged the Man of the Match for his heroics with the bat.",Comilla Victorians won by 25 runs,T20,Comilla Victorians vs Sylhet Sixers,3
"Khulna Titans are out of the tournament. And courtesy this 8-wicket canter, Rangpur Riders get another shot at finale. Gayle gets a big hug from Mortaza, who won a good toss, kept the target in check and allowed Gayle and Co. to unleash. But credit to Gayle for making the most of it, in the form of his fourth BPL hundred which helped him climb to the second spot on the list of run-makers this season. He hit 14 sixes, the most in an innings in BPL and gunned Khulna down as early as in the powerplay. This game was over before you could realize.",Rangpur Riders won by 8 wkts,T20,Khulna Titans vs Rangpur Riders,4
"That's a big win for Dhaka, gunning Comilla down to their first sub-hundred score in the history of BPL. There's still hope for Tamim's team. They will have a second shot at the finale berth, but can they recover from today's performance? An absolute mismatch of a contest between two top sides. Dhaka chose to bat and put the runs on the board. Despite a sluggish finish, they managed 191 which, in the end, proved to be more than enough. Comilla lost three wickets in the powerplay - Buttler being one of them - and that was a point of no return. Afridi got Tamim and Bravo in the same over when Comilla were looking to mount a partnership and that killed any hopes of a fightback.",Dhaka Dynamites won by 95 runs, T20,Comilla Victorians vs Dhaka Dynamites,2
"Joy for Mortaza. The fourth BPL title for him manifesting itself as Rangpur's first ever in the tournament's short history. Apt that Gayle gets to wrap the innings with the ball, after all but wrapping defending champions Dhaka with a blistering 69-ball 146 - his highest ever score in BPL that also happens to be the first century scored in the tournament's finale. Chasing 207, Dhaka looked baked. They didn't do themselves any favours, losing four inside the powerplay. Mortaza kicked things off with Maruf's wicket in the first over and then Gazi struck in consecutive overs, plundering away any chance Dhaka had at a rearguard. Jahurul Islam's rather quickfire fifty was as consolatory as it gets.",Rangpur Riders won by 57 runs,T20,Dhaka Dynamites vs Rangpur Riders,3
"A comprehensive win for Sirsa Warriors. Chasing a target of 131, their openers got them off to a flier and gave no openings whatsoever to their opponents. Kapil Kumar scored a dashing 73 with a strike rate of 192.11. He put on a 118-run stand with Talwinder for the first wicket. Panchkula Kings picked up four wickets, but it was all too late.",Sirsa Warriors won by 6 wkts, T20,Panchkula Kings vs Sirsa Warriors,3
What a match we had today. Sirsa were up against a mountain but got off to a flier. Gurugram pulled things back but Sarun kept batting with tremendous belief. Had the confidence of a lion to take the total down. Almost managed that but departed in the second last over to make the equation a little too tough. In the end Ankush Dhariwal held his nerves and helped Gurugram pull off this one.,Gurugram Gladiators won by 4 runs, T20,Sirsa Warriors vs Gurugram Gladiators,5
"A comprehensive win for Lancashire. James Anderson and his new ball partner - Mahmood set the tone scalping Hain and Barker respectively. Bell and Ambrose put on a 50-run stand for the third wicket. Once that was broken by Stephen Parry, there was no looking back for Lancashire. Parry finished with impressive figures of 3-12 off his quota of four overs and ensured that there wasn't any opening for Birmingham back in the game.",Lancashire won by 63 runs, T20,Lancashire vs Birmingham,2
"Lahore Qalandars win but only just. Feasting merrily on the no-balls and wides, mainly towards the end of the innings, Aaron Thomason stroked 44 off 27 to take Birmingham real close. Overs seventeen to nineteen yielded 42 runs, but in quite an anticlimax, Thornton ran out big-hitting Thomason and that was it, perhaps, as much as the wide off the first ball of the last over, with only 13 needed, might have suggested otherwise.",Lahore Qalandars won by 6 runs, T20,Lahore Qalandars vs Birmingham,4
