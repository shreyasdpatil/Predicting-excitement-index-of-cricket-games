"Easy chase in the end for New Zealand. Martin Guptill has been in prime form this season and he has helped NZ draw first blood. He got some useful support from Nicol, Brendon and Williamson on the way. The SA bowlers were good but were defending a total which was under par. They will look to do better in the 2nd match at Hamilton.",New Zealand won by 6 wkts,T20,South Africa vs New Zealand,2
"A couple of partnerships was all it needed for South Africa to chase this target and they got exactly that. They were in a bit of bother when they lost their first 3 wickets but de Villiers and JP Duminy put on a steady stand and built a solid platform. Runs were coming mainly in singles and doubles but the asking rate was never allowed to climb beyond comfort. Duminy fell but du Plessis walked in and played his shots, helping himself to a fifty in company of his skipper (who reached a century himself). In the end, it turned out to be a comfortable victory for the visitors.",South Africa won by 6 wkts,ODI,South Africa vs New Zealand,3
"One has to say that the better team won today. South Africa have been better in all disciplines in this series and they have shown it today. New Zealand will rue the batting collapse that took place in the batting powerplay. This total was below-par on a flat track and Amla ensured that South Africa suffered no serious hiccups. His 92 oozed with class and he was helped by some poor fielding from the Kiwis. Nicol dropped him once while Ryder dropped Duminy. Nethula impressed with two wickets but in the end, Brendon McCullum had a poor score to defend.",South Africa won by 6 wkts,ODI,South Africa vs New Zealand,3
"Nothing went right for the Kiwis today at Auckland. They got off to a poor start and the middle order failed again in the face of some hostile bowling from Steyn, de Lange and Peterson. Amla was at his supreme best as he stroked his 18th fifty. Parnell and Albie Morkel also chipped in with some good knocks. New Zealand made a fight of it towards the end but the result was never in doubt. ",South Africa won by 5 wkts,ODI,South Africa vs New Zealand,2
"Another comprehensive win for Ireland. They have managed to chase down the target very easily. Getting 108 was always easy, but they lost quick wickets initially, but Joyce and Kevin O'Brien held the innings together with a solid stand to ensure there were no further hiccups in the chase. Kenya were outclassed in all the departments today and they will be looking to put up a much improved performance in the next match tomorrow.",Ireland won by 6 wkts,T20,Ireland vs Kenya,2
"Easy win for Ireland in the end and they take an unassailable 2-0 lead in this 3-match series. They had rested Ed Joyce today and everyone thought chasing 132 would be difficult, but Stirling batted brilliantly to stay unbeaten till the end and also notched up his highest T20I score. On the other hand Kenyans are still searching for their first win.",Ireland won by 8 wkts,T20,Ireland vs Kenya,3
"A thrilling end to the series. Ireland complete a whitewash and rout Kenya 3-0 in this 3-match T20I series. Defending a low total, they struck at regular intervals to put pressure on Kenya. But C Obuya and Mishra fought pretty well and revived them a bit with a 50 run stand for the 3rd wicket. After C Obuya got out, they missed the trick and lost wickets at regular intervals to lose the match by a narrow margin. Once again Dockrell was the pick of the bowlers. Overall, Ireland will be satisfied by their performance in this tour.",Ireland won by 2 runs,T20,Ireland vs Kenya,4
What an amazing match this turned out to be. A real rollercoaster of a ride. Both sides were in it until the last few overs when Pakistan suddenly took the game away from the hosts. Tamim set up the run chase perfectly for Bangladesh with a half century. Shakib Al Hasan then battled until the end but his partners deserted him and he had to fight as the lone ranger for his team. At the end it was the Gulldozer who came out on top and really just bowled his side to victory courtesy those terrific reverse swinging yorkers.,Pakistan won by 21 runs,ODI,Bangladesh vs Pakistan,5
"Pakistan have outclassed their opponents today. Mahela who has impressed as a captain so far looked absolutely clueless today. Sri Lanka failed to put up a challenging total on the board and despite making a few early inroads, the total was just not enough. Umar Akmal and Misbah steadied the ship after those quick losses and really took their side through till the end. Akmal perished in the process of trying to secure the bonus point but Hammad Azam came in and struck the 5th ball that he faced to the fence to secure that extra point. Sri Lanka have had a dismal Asia Cup so far and now they are more or less out of the tournament. ",Pakistan won by 6 wkts,ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,3
"A superb chase aided by some dreadful bowling has sealed a famous win. The dew played its part, but full credit to the way the Bangladeshi batsmen applied themselves. Tamim gave them the perfect start and was well supported by Jahurul. Shakib and Rahim played some stunning cameos while Nasir was a revelation.",Bangladesh won by 5 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs India,4
The win also makes it Ireland's 7th win in a row. They lost their first match against Namibia but have been unstoppable since. This win is also as comprehensive as it can get. Paul Stirling and Porterfield made light work of the chase after their bowlers' good work. Canada will find it very difficult to lift themselves up after this loss.,Ireland won by 10 wkts,T20,Canada vs Ireland,2
Hugs and fist pumps all around from the Afghanistan team. This was a thorough team effort. The bowlers led by Dawlat Zadran kept things very tight and choked Namibia. Wickets came at regular intervals and Aftab Alam struck in quick succession late in the innings to hasten proceedings. ,Afghanistan won by 47 runs,T20,Afghanistan vs Namibia,3
"Crushing win this for Ireland. Namibia were never in the game and the 2nd innings was just a mere formality for the Irish who certainly deserved their place in the mega event set to be held in September. Stirling was very impressive, but it must be said that Namibia's bowling was pedestrian. ",Ireland won by 9 wkts,T20,Ireland vs Namibia,1
"Zadran gave his side a dream start by castling Porterfield 1st ball but Stirling simply took the game away with breath-taking strokeplay. The Irish seemed well on course to canter home, but wickets off successive balls by that man - Zadran again reignited Afghanistan's hopes. But Gary Wilson stayed calm and struck some crucial blows to ensure his side had no trouble at the end.",Ireland won by 5 wkts,T20,Afghanistan vs Ireland,4
"A comprehensive win for the Aussies in the end. Chasing 205 was bit tricky on this slow and low pitch, But the Australian bowlers bowled a tight line and made life tougher for WI. After losing 3 early wickets Samuels and Dwayne Bravo put together an important stand of 64 for the 4th wicket, but Christian provided the much needed breathrough by removing Bravo and rest of the batsmen soon followed him by playing some loose shots. Sammy showed some fight towards the end, but he had ran out of partners and he was the last batsman to get out.",Australia won by 64 runs,ODI,Windies vs Australia,4
"This is West Indies' first win against Australia since the champions trophy game in India in 2006. A moment to remember indeed. It has been an absolute team effort. The bowlers did a great job to restrict the Aussies, and the batsmen backed it up with a good show. Powell fell early and the top order got starts. They lost a few wickets in the middle but Dwayne Bravo and Pollard put on a 64 run stand for the 5th wicket to seal the game. Bravo fell towards the end, but Pollard and Baugh finished the game.",WI won by 5 wkts,ODI,Windies vs Australia,4
"Phew! My fingers are taking a pounding here. What a match. This has been nothing short of a classic. Every over had twists, drama and brilliance. The top order collapsed in the phase of some disciplined bowling by Watson and Doherty. However, Baugh and Russell shared a 64 run stand to keep the Windies in the hunt. However, they lost wickets towards the end as the pressure mounted. Naraine stuck some lusty blows but in the end, a brain explosion resulted in the match being tied.",Match tied,ODI,Windies vs Australia,5
"So Australia have finally shown some dominance on this tour. They were a bit too loose in the ODI series, but thanks to Watson and Hussey, their batting has come into their own. Warner departed in the first over, but both the aforementioned batsmen played the big shots with ease to bring down the required run rate. Narine was the pick of the bowlers as he went for just 21 runs in 4 overs, but could not pick any wickets. Overall a bullying win for Australia",Australia won by 8 wkts,T20,Windies vs Australia,2
"Fidel Edwards sent back Watson early but Warner kept them in the game with a blazing fifty. However, some brilliant fielding from Dwayne Bravo resulted in Warner being run-out and West Indies came back in the game. Marlon Samuels and Fidel bowled a wonderful 18th and 19th over as they took wickets and gave away few runs. In the end, the West Indies held their nerve as they clinched the match by 14 runs to level the series 1-1. ",West Indies won by 14 runs,T20,Windies vs Australia,4
"Today's match saw fireworks from the South African batsmen and just when the Indian batsmen, especially Gambhir, were beginning to display theirs, rain dampened them out. Ontong played a blinder at the end to boost the score above the 200 mark. During India's chase, Gambhir playing some sublime strokes to help India stay on par even as Uthappa, at the other end, struggled to time the ball well. Although the required rate was high, India were looking set to get close to it. Unfortunately, rain had the final laugh, and it meant that South Africa won the game. They haven't had much luck with the Duckworth and Lewis in the past, but today it went their way.",South Africa won by 11 runs (D/L method),T20,South Africa vs India,3
"A clinical performance from England today has helped them rout WI by a comfortable margin. Chasing 288 was tough and West Indies needed one batsman to score big, but that didn't happen even though Smith started off aggressively and got to a quickfire fifty. None of the other batsmen supported him well and rain arrived to stop the game. Upon resumption, Samuels started off well with some big hits, but they soon lost wickets in a heap and folded up cheaply. Darren Bravo also came down the order because of a groin injury and that didn't help their cause. England go one up in this 3-match series.",England won by 114 runs (D/L method),ODI,England vs Windies,2
"West Indies never seemed to be in the game, even when Dwayne Bravo, Keiron Pollard and Darren Sammy scored some quick runs in their batting powerplay. It was England throughout the day starting with some splendid swing bowling by Anderson, Finn and Broad and ending with some clinical one day batting by Cook, Bell and Trott. The target could have been tricky if they had lost a few early wickets, but Bell and Cook did not give even half chances for the visitors to grab. Cook played a few eye-catching and aggressive strokes and scored his 5th ODI ton. Narine failed to inspire once again and the rest of the bowlers, save for Best, looked flat throughout the day. ",England won by 8 wkts,ODI,England vs Windies,2
"A high scoring game and England emerge winners once again. 173 was a stiff target but Bopara and Hales made it look too easy. They ran hard, converted singles into doubles and kept finding the boundary regularly. Hales deserved a century but fell agonisingly short by just 1 run, but did enough to ensure a win for England.",England won by 7 wkts,T20,England vs Windies,5
This is now the lowest T20 total in Sri Lanka. The hosts have really fought very well to defend what looked to be a modest total. Pakistan's batting was all over the place and none of the batsmen looked very comfortable against the short delivery. Kulasekara gave his side the perfect start by taking two wickets off the first two balls of the chase. Ahmed Shehzad finished up as the highest scorer amongst both teams but his innings of 36 came at a snail's pace and lasted 42 balls. Yet again Pakistan have bowled well but haven't finished up on top owing to some poor shot selection. Some credit obviously has to be given to Sri Lanka for their bowling and sharpness in the field.,Sri Lanka won by 37 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,5
"The first leg of the tour ends at 1-1. Some positives for both teams though the batting will be a cause of concern for either team's management. The bowling was superb by either sides with Sami joining the party with some outstanding pace. Afridi has to be the story of the day, he came in with Pakistan struggling. His fifty propelled the visitors to a fighting total which was a bridge too far for the visitors on a difficult track.",Pakistan won by 23 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,5
"A clinical performance has helped Pakistan win this match by 6 wickets. Chasing a low total, they lost Azhar Ali and Younis early, but Hafeez and Misbah held the innings together with a fifty plus stand, which was instrumental in their win today. With this win, Pakistan have now won 9 of their past 11 ODIs against Sri Lanka. This match also will be remembered as one of the longest matches played as it was interrupted thrice by rain today and not many overs were reduced. Sri Lanka's batting let them down and they will hope to put up a much better performance in the next ODI.",Pakistan won by 6 wickets (D/L method),ODI,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,5
"Convincing and clinical showing by Sri Lanka. After the mediocre performance in the first ODI, the batsmen came back well to put on a score of 280. Dilshan batted really well, carrying his bat through and in the process scored a hundred. Pakistan looked to be in the game when Misbah and Azhar Ali were batting in the middle, but once the skipper fell, the other batsmen followed him back to the pavilion. After Umar Akmal had to return back thanks to a horrendous decision, the onus was on Afridi to take his side home. But a brilliant catch from Sangakkara sent him back for just 17 and the game pretty much ended then and there. ",Sri Lanka won by 76 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,5
"What a game this has been. Indeed it has been a great exhibition for the 50 over game. Pakistan, for the second time in the series, were coasting along in the middle overs. Like in the 2nd ODI, it was the skipper Misbah and Azhar Ali who were anchoring the chase. But unfortunately for them, the batting powerplay turned out to be a nightmare as they lost Misbah and then Umar Akmal during that passage of play. It only went from bad to worse as Thissara Perera proceeded to pick a hat-trick in the 41st over and Pakistan collapsed from 166/2 to 199 all out. Perera once again shone through with 4 wickets, but you have got to hand it to Mahela's intuitive captaincy. He kept the pressure on the visitors despite a 113 run 3rd wicket stand. Azhar Ali once again was the lone ranger and carried his bat through, scoring an unbeaten and defiant 81 in the process.",Sri Lanka won by 44 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,5
Sri Lanka stuttered in their chase early as they lost their openers without doing much damage. Then Sanga and Chandimal stitched a partnership and they found it hard to negotiate the spinners in the middle overs. Misbah lost the plot before the toss only when he left out Ajmal and got in Sami in his place. This pitch was conducive for spin bowling and they were one spinner short. They were also pretty ordinary in the field and too many runs were conceded as a result of which Sri Lankans got away when they needed runs. Mathews played an innings of substance as he single-handedly took his team through even though he lost partners at the other end. Sami's figures are the most expensive by a Pakistani in Sri Lanka.,Sri Lanka won by 2 wkts,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,5
It has been a commanding performance from South Africa. Ashraful played some good strokes but he played a loose shot and was dismissed. The middle order failed to put up much of a fight. Mahmudullah and Rahim sparkled towards the end. Rahim capitalized on some bad bowling from Wayne Parnell as he scored a fifty. The South Africans were a bit off the boil in the final overs and they will look to overcome that.,South Africa won by 39 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs South Africa,5
"What a performance by Zimbabwe. Mpofu bowled wonderfully at the start. He cleverly mixed his pace and the South African batsmen found the going tough. Cremer then flummoxed the Proteas with his leg breaks and googly. Colin Ingram put up a bit of a fight after surviving a dropped chance on 0. However, in the end, it was a bridge too far for South Africa and they have suffered defeat by 29 runs.",Zimbabwe won by 29 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs South Africa,5
"An easy win in the end for the Proteas and they take on Zimbabwe again tomorrow in the finals. They looked a better unit today and their fielding and bowling was much better than the previous matches. Parnell was the the pick of the bowlers, taking 3 for 16 from his 4 overs and that was the difference between the two sides today. SA had to chase down the target in 15 overs to knock Zimbabwe out of the tournament, but ZIM spinners bowled some tight overs in the middle to make sure they reach the finals.",South Africa won by 6 wkts,T20,Zimbabwe vs South Africa,5
"Excellent win for the hosts, truly deserving. Taylor led the way with a captain's knock, he was all class today, wonder why he is never considered for a contract in any T20 franchises across the world? That is for later though, Masakadza was scratchy but did well to stay and aid his skipper. Good practise ahead of the T20 WC for them. Gary Kirsten and Allan Donald will have some work, SA did miss some of their stars but their efforts were patchy in this tournament.",Zimbabwe won by 9 wkts,T20,Zimbabwe vs South Africa,3
"An easy win in the end for England. They bowled well as a unit and successfully defended the total. After they were put in by Australia, they got off to a solid start, but lost quick wickets in the middle. Morgan took the centre stage thereafter and played an incredible innings to help England to a decent total. Australia lost Watson cheaply, but Warner and Bailey stitched together a solid partnership. They lost both set batsmen quickly and only Clarke showed some character in the middle, with the other batsmen failing to make any valuable contribution. Wade was playing well for his 27, but a terrible mix-up in the middle cut short his innings and that was the last nail in the coffin for Australia.",England won by 15 runs,ODI,England vs Australia,4
"Once again, England have outplayed Australia in all departments. Bell looked in wonderful touch as he stroked his 21st ODI fifty. Clint McKay bowled with a lot of heart but he found no support from the other bowlers. Ravi Bopara scored his first ever half-century against Australia and along with Morgan, he helped England go 2-0 up in the series.",England won by 6 wkts,ODI,England vs Australia,3
"Yet another convincing victory for the hosts. The bowlers set it up by restricting Australia in the first half and the batsmen made the chase look easy. Bell and Trott got half centuries and Bopara contributed too. Australia were never in the game, and to make it worse, suffered a couple of injury blows too (Watson and Lee). ",England won by 8 wkts,ODI,England vs Australia,2
"West Indies have outclassed New Zealand in all departments. 210 was always going to be a difficult target on a pitch that got slower. Nicol tried to be aggressive but he had no support from the other batsmen. Narine had another impressive match. Taylor retired hurt on 10 to give New Zealand more anxious moments. Oram provided a flourish towards the end but in the end, it was a bridge too far for the Kiwis as they lost the match by 56 runs.",West Indies won by 56 runs, T20,Windies vs New Zealand,3
"Clinical performance by West Indies. This has been a comprehensive win for them. New Zealand were never in the game after Narine rattled them early on. Badree, Samuels and Bravo did their bit too. It was a complete team performance and this side looks the team to beat. New Zealand looked down and out from the first ball and they will have to ask some really tough questions.",West Indies won by 61 runs, T20,Windies vs New Zealand,2
"It has been an efficient performance from the West Indies. Gayle and Dwayne Smith carted the New Zealand bowlers to all parts of the ground as their partnership propelled West Indies along. At one point, one felt that the match could be abandoned due to rain but luckily it blew away. The Kiwi bowlers lacked intensity and failed to create pressure.",WI won by 9 wkts (D/L method), ODI,Windies vs New Zealand,2
"West Indies have completed a comprehensive victory. After setting a huge total, the pressure was always on the Kiwis. Guptill started things off on a positive note by getting to his half century but couldn't convert it into a big innings. New Zealand always needed someone to play right through the match and strike at a good rate, however, they were always left wanting. Williamson and Watling also got half centuries but the lack of support and the lack of quick runs found New Zealand short of the target. West Indies now enjoy a 2-0 lead in this five match series.",West Indies won by 55 runs, ODI,Windies vs New Zealand,3
Not a lot of people would have placed their money on a 88 run victory for New Zealand at the start of the game. They had had a very poor tour so far and were showing very little signs of any improvement but somehow everything clicked for them in this game. Nathan McCullum scored a gutsy fifty to prop up the NZ innings early on. The bowlers seemed buoyed by the effort and put in a clinical performance to shoot West Indies out for their lowest ever total at St. Kitts.,New Zealand won by 88 runs, ODI,Windies vs New Zealand,4
"Tino Best and Sunil Narine were the absolute stars in the bowling line-up. The NZ batsmen had no clue against Narine while Best troubled them with his hostile pace and bounce. Ross Taylor played a fantastic knock and scored his 6th ODI century. However, there was no support from the other end and in the end New Zealand succumbed to a 24 run defeat. ",West Indies won by 24 runs, ODI,Windies vs New Zealand,3
"Wild celebrations in the Windies camp and they thoroughly deserve it. This is a much better outfit as they were bolstered by the comeback of Gayle. Narine was the wrecker-in-chief in this match, taking his first 5-wicket haul in ODIs, but all through the series he bamboozled the Kiwi batsmen as they struggled to score runs against him. On the other hand, Kiwis have a lot of thinking to do as they were hampered by the injuries and their in-experienced middle order was exposed against a strong WI attack. Only Taylor and Williamson played well, but they didn't get much support from the other end.",West Indies won by 20 runs, ODI,Windies vs New Zealand,4
"That ends this tie, and Scotland were the better side in all departments. The Scots had to chase a low total and they decided to play aggressively in order to do so. It was MacLeod who held the innings together and led his side to a big win. Canada's bowlers and fielders looked quite jaded for most parts of the match, perhaps they couldn't get over the fact that they were actually finally playing a game.",Scotland won by 4 wkts,ODI,Scotland vs Canada,3
"After putting on a small total on board, the Scots needed to do bowl really well to win the game. But they were blown away by Nowroz Mangal. The opener started off silently, but launched a vicious assault to go from 66 to 101 in the space of 9 balls which left the bowlers and fielders surprised and shocked. This is a big win for the Asian side and one that will give them a lot of confidence.",Afghanistan won by 7 wkts,ODI,Afghanistan vs Scotland,3
"Easy win for Afghanistan in the end. The lack of bowling discipline from the Scots cost them in the end. Mohammad Shahzad got the right start for the Afghans with a blazing 48 while Nabi made sure that there were no hiccups towards the end with a sparkling fifty. Kyle Coetzer's fine 133 went in vain, his 1st century at this level.",Afghanistan won by 5 wkts,ODI,Afghanistan vs Scotlands,3
"Finally Scotland held their nerve to prevail in a close match. The match went into the reserve day as most part of yesterday was washed out due to rain. The play was interrupted again due to rain today and in the end, Scotland who were ahead according to D/L method had to get around 33 runs in less than 7 overs to gain crucial 2 points.",Scotland won by 4 wickets (D/L method),ODI,Scotland vs Kenya,2
"Emphatic win by the Irish here! They are just one win away from qualifying for the ICC World Cup 2015. After putting up a decent total batting first, they came on to put up a brilliant bowling show. The star of today's game was Kevin O'Brien, who had earlier chipped in with a wonderful cameo of 32 to accelerate the run-rate. He then came on to put up his best bowling performance picking up 4 important wickets. In the end, the Dutch could not hold on and crumbled against the Irish pace.",Ireland won by 88 runs,ODI,Netherlands vs Ireland,3
This is the first time that a game is tied in the ICC World Cricket League Championship. Netherlands should have won it easily after being well set at one stage. They played a little slowly as the innings neared its death. But credit to the Ireland bowlers for making life difficult for the batsmen. It was down to 13 runs required off the last over. John Mooney was given to duties and he started off in grand fashion conceding just 2 runs in the first four balls. But Rippon held his nerve and managed to stun the Irish by his lusty hits in the last two balls.,Match tied,ODI,Netherlands vs Ireland,5
"What a spell by Mahmudullah! He completely changed the equation in favor of Bangladesh. He gave just 4 runs in the 18th over and followed it up with a brilliant final over to help Bangladesh clinch the series. Ireland kept the required rate under check for most parts of the chase but couldn't quite finish it off. Stirling, Joyce and Wilson got starts but at least one of them should have carried on and seen them through.",Bangladesh won by 1 run, T20,Ireland vs Bangladesh,5
"Superb show from Bangladesh. They seemed to be down and out at one stage, but fought back superbly. Mashrafe was the man. He followed up his 4 wickets with some blistering blows to seal the isue.",Bangladesh won by 2 wkts, T20,Ireland vs Bangladesh,4
"A comfortable win in the end for the Proteas and they go one up in the series and dethrone England to claim the no.1 spot in ODIs also. They were in the driver's seat after they posted a huge total on the board and that was mainly to a master piece innings of 150 by the modern day run machine Amla. The pitch was always expected to take turn under the lights and even the part time SA spinners got vicious turn and English batsmen had no answer to that and lost wickets in a heap. Only Morgan fought a hard battle, but he didn't get any support from the other end. Samit entertained the crowds with a stroke-filled 45, but that was not enough for them to get anywhere close to the SA total.",South Africa won by 80 runs, ODI,England vs South Africa,3
"England have sealed a much-needed win. Jonathan Trott and Eoin Morgan stroked some wonderful fifties to guide England along. Despite some good bowling from Peterson and Parnell, the target of 212 was never going to be daunting.",England won by 4 wkts, ODI,England vs South Africa,3
"Storming finish by England and they retain the No.1 rank irrespective of the next match. South Africa were always playing the second fiddle after losing the toss, they pottered around to 220. The bowling barring Steyn was lacklustre. Bell played the anchor with an attractive 88 while Trott, Morgan and Kieswetter chipped in with useful scores.",England won by 6 wkts, ODI,England vs South Africa,2
England got a few early wickets but they could not break this unbeaten 90 run stand. Kallis and Duminy played very well while the England bowlers struggled. Dernbach and Finn were the pick of the bowlers but no one else supported them.,South Africa won by 7 wkts, T20,England vs South Africa,3
"A convincing win for the T20 champions and they go into the T20 World Cup with lot of confidence. They were sent into bat after the match was reduced to 11 overs due to rain. They didn't get off to a electrifying start, but the penultimate over from Parnell changed the course of the game as Buttler plundered 30 runs. Chasing on this pitch under the lights was always going to be difficult. Swann and Briggs got the ball to turn viciously and the Proteas never got going. Even their run machine Amla couldn't get the odd boundaries regularly. The three match series is drawn 1-1 after the second match was washed out due to rain. But overall a poor performance from the Proteas in this series",England won by 28 runs, T20,England vs South Africa,2
"Phew! India made a meal of this in the final overs. Sangakkara played a solid knock and Thisara chipped in with a wonderful cameo. But, in the end, the asking rate was too much and Sri Lanka were always behind the eight ball. Malinga got some batting practice towards the end. Barring Irfan Pathan and Ashwin who bowled well, all the other Indian bowlers were carted around. The Indian fielding was also very sloppy and they have a lot of work to do ahead of the second ODI.",India won by 21 runs, ODI,Sri Lanka vs India,3
"That seals a comprehensive win for Sri Lanka. They have absolutley demolished India in this game and have come back in a very strong manner. After skittling India out for a low score, the Lankans made merry with the bat and piled on the pressure right from the start. Dilshan played his natural game by going after the bowling while Tharanga displayed some immaculate timing. Both batsmen got to their half centuries and Tharanga held fort until the end to see his side through to victory.",Sri Lanka won by 9 wkts, ODI,Sri Lanka vs India,3
"That seals India's 400th ODI victory and it gives them an unassailable 3-1 series lead. Virat Kohli and Raina played magnificently to take India home. Sri Lanka started off very well by dismissing Gambhir early and left India struggling at 60 for 3. Manoj Tiwary and Kohli then put on a partnership of 49, before Jeevan Mendis got a brave lbw decision in his favour to dismiss Tiwary. It was Raina then who partnered Kohli till the end and kept his composure. Credit this time though has to go to Kohli, who stuck at it right through the innings and piled on yet another century against Sri Lanka. Once he and Raina had settled in, they simply tore through the bowling line up. Eventually India cruised through to 6 wicket victory.",India won by 6 wkts, ODI,Sri Lanka vs India,3
"Historic moment this for Scotland. This is their first victory against a Test playing nation. The Scotland bowlers kept things tight. Haq and Davey picked up three wickets and none of the Bangladesh batsmen got going. This is a deserved victory for Scotland and for Bangladesh, they have come crashing down to earth with a bang after clean-sweeping Ireland.",Scotland won by 34 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs Scotland,3
"What a way to finish the game and what a way to come back after their loss to Scotland. Bangladesh will feel that they have finally redeemed themselves. They were always on top of their opponents in the chase. Tamim Iqbal played aggressively right from the start and never really let the bowlers settle down. Shakib got out a little early and for a moment the Dutch would have felt that they could stage a come back but those hopes were washed away by a sparkling cameo from Rahim. At the end of the day, there was a clear difference in the quality of the two sides and that resulted in Bangladesh running away with the game.",Bangladesh won by 8 wkts, T20,Netherlands vs Bangladesh,2
"Netherlands level the series 1-1. Bangladesh will look back at their batting collapse. They recovered to post 128 but that didn't prove to be enough. Netherlands struggled to get partnerships but Swart stayed on and almost took them home. He fell towards the end but the tail kept their nerves, and Ahsan Malik finished the game with a last ball boundary. Netherlands will never forget this game of cricket - a thrilling and much deserved win for them.",Netherlands won by 1 wkt, T20,Netherlands vs Bangladesh,5
MS Dhoni will come in for much criticism. 22 at less than run a ball has cost India but enough credit should be given to the Kiwi bowlers. The cutters worked very well as the ball got older and the big hits just failed to come off. Yuvraj Singh managed a good show in his much awaited comeback but he will be a very disappointed man after failing to take India through. Virat Kohli was outstanding too and India were in complete control with him out in the middle. The win coming from behind will be a huge boost for the tourists. They clinch the series too with that.,New Zealand won by 1 run, T20,India vs New Zealand,5
"Professional performance from Australia. They took their time while batting before exploding in the end to get 272. The reply from AFG was entertaining. Stanikzai showed good application in making a career best 66, Nabi chipped in with 46 and the tail swung around merrily to take Afghanistan beyond 200. They will have learnt quite a lot from today's match, they were beaten but certainly not disgraced.",Australia won by 66 runs,ODI,Afghanistan vs Australia,2
"Oh boy, Australia had to fight every inch of their way to get to this target. The spinners maintained the pressure throughout as Australia found the going tough. Saeed Ajmal, in particular, confounded the Australians with his doosra. However, Michael Clarke and George Bailey showed admirable composure by striking solid fifties as they guided Australia to a four wicket win. ",Australia won by 4 wkts, ODI ,Pakistan vs Australia,3
"Comprehensive win from Pakistan. They were lucky to lose the toss, their spinners enjoyed bowling on a slow and low track. Chasing 249, Hafeez and Jamshed got them off to a breezy start. Jamshed's innings was the cornerstone, he played some scintillating strokes before the heat took a toll on him. Azhar Ali and Misbah then made sure that the win was achieved without any more fuss. ",Pakistan won by 7 wkts, ODI,Pakistan vs Australia,2
"Good chase from Australia. The openers started positively, the middle order stuttered in the face of some magic from Ajmal before Mike Hussey took over. He was lucky when Pakistan failed to review an LBW appeal on 0, added some vital runs with Wade to settle the nerves before Maxwell took over to seal the win. He finished the match in some style and also completed his maiden ODI fifty.",Australia won by 3 wkts,ODI,Pakistan vs Australia,2
"Australia didn't even compete. They were bowled out for their second lowest score in T20Is and were never in a position to challenge Pakistan after that. Hafeez, Imran Nazir and Kamran Akmal enjoyed some batting practice and Pakistan finished the match with 31 balls to spare. They will be happy with Kamran Akmal's contribution in particular; he looked aggressive and confident and helped himself to some runs as well. The lesser said about Australia the better. This is their biggest loss in terms of balls to spare.",Pakistan won by 7 wkts,T20,Pakistan vs Australia,2
"Oh boy, that concludes what has been a fantastic match. This is probably where experience counts. Gul bowled a fantastic over while Cummins showed his inexperience and sprayed it all over the place. Umar Akmal and Razzaq held their cool and scored the required 12 runs to clinch the series 2-0. This is the sixth tied match in T20Is.",Match tied (Pakistan won the one-over eliminator),T20,Pakistan vs Australia,5
"A comprehensive performance by the Aussies. Though the scorecard for the series will say 2-1, this win is likely to keep them in really high spirits. The openers Watson and Warner clicked big time and showed Dubai and those watching on TV, what destruction they could cause. Later, Starc and Cummins, with their pace and swing, literally ran through the top order and reminded Pakistan's fans just how unpredictable their side could be. Just three Pakistani batsmen crossed into double figures and none of the three scored at faster than a run a ball. In one word, Australia's performance today can be termed as 'Dominating'.",Australia won by 94 runs,T20,Pakistan vs Australia,2
This match will be remembered for the performance of both Ajantha and Jeevan Mendis. The Zimbabwe batsmen failed to negotiate these two and they capitulated tamely. Ajantha Mendis now has the best haul in T20 cricket with match figures of 4-2-8-6. Jeevan Mendis continued his wonderful match as he snapped up three wickets.,Sri Lanka won by 82 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe,3
Watson made all the difference for the Australians as they got off to a flying start and raced along to 60 in seven overs. Dockrell sent back Warner but Watson powered his way to an aggressive fifty. Australia lost a couple of wickets towards the end but White steadied the ship and helped them seal victory by 7 wickets.,Australia won by 7 wkts,T20,Australia vs Ireland,2
"The scorecard says won by 23 runs but there were a few nervous moments for India. The catching was the difference in the end. Afghanistan dropped 4 catches, while India took everything that came their way. Shahzad, Mangal and Sadiq got off to starts but none could convert it. Balaji gave the first breakthrough and that was followed by a triple strike from Yuvraj, which plucked the life out of the Afghan challenge. Mohammad Nabi fought down the order with a 17 ball 31, but when he fell to Ashwin, the game was well and truly India's.",India won by 23 runs,T20,India vs Afghanistan,2
South Africa were never going to be troubled by this paltry score. Levi and Amla ensured that they reached the target without any hiccups. Levi got to his first T20I fifty (to go along with a century) as Zimbabwe suffered their 14th consecutive loss in T20Is. This is also the second instance where a team has won by 10 wickets in all editions of this tournament.*,South Africa won by 10 wkts,T20,South Africa vs Zimbabwe,4
Bangladesh have now lost nine consecutive T20Is in all editions of this tournament. They were never in the contest once Tamim and Shakib departed cheaply. Nasir Hossain hung in there and scored a gritty fifty but he did not get support. Most of the NZ bowlers chipped in and helped the team achieve victory by 59 runs. ,New Zealand won by 59 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs New Zealand,2
"Sri Lanka were never in the match after T Dilshan was run out without facing a ball. Dilshan Munaweera looked ill at ease and failed to score freely. Nobody in the Lankan line-up could play a knock like the one played by de Villiers which ultimately made the difference. South Africa have a lot of soul-searching to do. Levi and du Plessis failed once again, while their high catching in this game has been pathetic.",South Africa won by 32 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,1
"Very good cricket from Pakistan. They batted superbly led by the impressive Nasir Jamshed. Their bowling was effective without being spectacular. Saeed Ajmal was the exception. He was brought in only in the 12th over but maintained his calm under pressure to help Pakistan get through. Taylor, Franklin and Oram struck some late blows but they were left with too much to do in the end. Pakistan will take a lot of confidence from this hard fought win.",Pakistan won by 13 runs,T20,New Zealand vs Pakistan,3
"It was a dismal performance with the ball from Bangladesh. They showed a lot of spirit with the bat, Shakib led the way there but there was no one to do a similar role with the ball. The pacers were guilty of bowling too many short deliveries. Imran Nazir put them away in style and together with Hafeez, the duo ensured that Pakistan made it through with little trouble.",Pakistan won by 8 wkts,T20,Bangladesh vs Pakistan,1
"Eoin Morgan will be a disappointed man. He has scored an unbeaten 71 off just 36 balls but even that was not enough to take England past the line. It was all because of the horror start they got - Rampaul started with a double wicket maiden and England took their own sweet time to rebuild. Bairstow in particular struggled to get going and that kept pushing up the required run rate. Hales and Morgan kept trying, and with some luck going their way, even put some pressure on West Indies, but the target was always beyond their reach.",West Indies won by 15 runs,T20,England vs Windies,3
"So, for the third time in a row, South Africa have been unable to defeat Pakistan in the T20 Cup. The Pakistani camp is absolutely thrilled to bits. After a brisk start, Pakistan lost three wickets quickly and they continued to lose wickets in the middle overs. Umar Akmal played a mature hand and guided Pakistan along. However, it was Gul's 17 ball 32 that changed the tide of the match for Pakistan. The 51 run stand between Gul and Umar Akmal made South Africa panicky as they leaked 36 runs in two overs.",Pakistan won by 2 wkts,T20,Pakistan vs South Africa,4
"England complete a convincing win over New Zealand.  Undoubtedly the star of the game was Luke Wright. While the other batsmen struggled a bit against the slow bowlers, Wright played a stunning knock, smashing five sixes and an equal number of fours in the process. None of the NZ bowlers did anything extraordinary, though their fielding was outstanding.",England won by 6 wkts,T20,England vs New Zealand,3
Sri Lanka have bossed this game and Mahela has played a perfect captain's knock. The bowlers set it up first and Mahela guided them with the bat. Sangakkara gave his skipper some solid support as the hosts chased the low target down with absolute ease.,Sri Lanka won by 9 wkts,T20,Sri Lanka vs Windies,2
"Another convincing performance from the Aussies. It was the Shane Watson show once again today. 2 wickets with the ball and a 47 ball blitz which saw him scoring 70. South Africa have much to think. Their ground fielding has been excellent in parts, but their catching has been awful. They still have an outside chance to make the semis. For that they will want India to win against Pakistan.",Australia won by 8 wkts,T20,Australia vs South Africa,2
"Convincing win in the end for Sri Lanka. They have Lasith Malinga to thank for, he ripped through the top order in his first spell and returned at crucial times to dig a hole in the England line-up. He was well supported by Kulasekara and Dananjaya as Sri Lanka wrapped it up in style. Samit Patel was the lone batsman to show some fight with a spunky 67, Swann threatened to upset West Indies with a fine cameo but it was too little and too late.",Sri Lanka won by 19 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs England,3
The Pakistani spinners proved to be a handful on this pitch. Raza Hasan and Saeed Ajmal were too good for the Australian top order. Watson failed for the first time and it took a brilliant fifty from Michael Hussey to guide Australia past the target of 112 which was needed for them to qualify for the semi-finals. ,Pakistan won by 32 runs,T20,Australia vs Pakistan,3
"Excellent cricket from Sri Lanka. They have managed to defend a average score. The bowling was outstanding, were backed up by some athletic fielding, the pitch did play its part as it made the batsmen struggle to play their shots with any fluency. Pakistan never looked like they would come anywhere close to the target, Nazir gave them a decent start but the middle order struggled as the spinners came on. The death blow was the twin dismissals of skipper Hafeez and the woefully out of form Afridi. Umar Akmal fought well but neither he nor Umar Gul could do little to snatch victory.",Sri Lanka won by 16 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,3
"It has been a wonderful performance from the West Indies. They were much better in all departments today. Gayle and Pollard took the game away as their big hits took West Indies beyond 200. Australia never got going and they were restricted to 43/6. Bailey came in and scored his first T20I fifty. However, the asking rate was too much as Australia suffered a 74 run defeat. It will be Sri Lanka versus West Indies on 7th.",West Indies won by 74 runs,T20,Australia vs Windies,3
New Zealand did very well with the bat. In fact they got to their highest ever score against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. They would have backed themselves to put up a fight with that total. Sri Lanka's chase was held together by Dilshan and Jayawardene. The former was struggling but still stuck in to put on a good stand. They did well to be ahead of the D/L par score when the rain came in and deservingly went 1-0 up in the series.,Sri Lanka win by 14 runs (D/L method),ODI,Sri Lanka vs New Zealand,3
"The rain-marred game finally managed to produce some entertaining cricket. Watling started it off with a splendid knock and Sri Lanka had a stiff target to chase. It became even more difficult after they lost some quick wickets early on. Dilshan had hung on in the initial stages and with Mathews for company, began to open up further. The dew played a factor too but NZ were in the game until it went into the last 10 overs. The experienced duo upped the ante just when SL needed it and cruised to a comfortable victory.",Sri Lanka won by 7 wkts (D/L method),ODI,Sri Lanka vs New Zealand,3
"Sri Lanka never looked in any strife though it must be said that Boult and Southee beat the bat on numerous occasions during their opening spell. Chandimal lived a charmed life and Boult could have got him at least a couple of times. After the initial difficult phase, the chase became relatively easy and though the batsmen slowed down considerably towards the end, the job was complete with ease.",Sri Lanka won by 7 wkts (D/L method),ODI,Sri Lanka vs New Zealand,2
Bangladesh have outplayed West Indies in all departments. 200 was never going to be too much and it became very easy after Tamim Iqbal started the chase with an aggressive half century. All the batsmen contributed in the chase which is a very good sign ahead of the series. Nothing much to say about the West Indies. They were totally outclassed and will have to forget this game before the next one.,Bangladesh won by 7 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs Windies,2
"A spectacular victory for Bangladesh. They have trumped their fancied opponents by a massive 160 run margin. West Indies were never in the chase right from the first ball, they lost their openers very early and never recovered from there on. The spinners came into the party with Gazi and Razzak taking three wickets each. This is also Bangladesh's biggest ever win in terms of runs.",Bangladesh won by 160 runs,ODI,Bangladesh vs Windies,3
"A chase anchored by Marlon Samuels. He was well supported by Kieron Powell as the visitors cruised along. They lost a few wickets in a hurry towards the end but the presence of Samuels was vital. Bangladesh bowled their hearts out, especially the spinners who made the ball talk despite all the dew. The series now stands at 2-1 in favour of the hosts with two still to play.",West Indies won by 4 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs Windies,3
Bangladesh's jinx at Mirpur continues. They have blown away a 2-0 lead and will now head to tommorrow's final match with all to play for. Sammy was the star of the show today. He followed his unbeaten 60 with an incisive burst that saw him grab 3 top order wickets. He was well supported by Roach who took 2 as the hosts slid to 13/5. The match was over and only a fighting 56 from Mahmudullah delayed the final outcome.,West Indies won by 75 runs,ODI,Bangladesh vs Windies,2
"The Bangladesh batting collapsed again as Roach ripped through the top order. However, a fantastic 81 run stand between Mahmudullah and Rahim put Bangladesh back on track. However, they lost quick wickets again and it took a 53 run stand between Nasir Hossain and Mominul Haque to get Bangladesh closer to victory. In the end, Nasir Hossain held firm and scored the winning runs to seal a 3-2 victory.",Bangladesh won by 2 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs Windies,3
"Bangladesh should not be satisfied with this performance. When you lose just 1 wicket, you should expect to score more than just 179 on a flat track. Mahmudullah went past a half century and Tamim Iqbal almost made a century, but they missed out on a lot of scoring chances in the middle overs. At least 10 full tosses were wasted and Bangladesh have been made to pay for that. For West Indies, it was Gayle's off spin which made the difference. He conceded only 18 runs in his 4 overs in the middle and changed the game their way. Bangladesh will look back at the game and reckon that the last over from Rubel Hossain where he conceded 29 runs was the turning point.*",West Indies won by 18 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs Windies,3
"England were never in the game after they lost a flurry of wickets post a strong start. On a batting paradise a score well in excess of 180 runs was required. The fact that India's batsmen came out attacking made things difficult for them as well. Yuvraj Singh dazzled with an all-round performance and should surely be the Man of the Match. In retrospect, England will feel that they were about 20 runs short and bowled one wide too many.",India won by 5 wkts,T20,India vs England,2
England have squared the series 1-1. The chase was very professional from England. The openers gave them a great start. Yuvraj Singh pulled things back with a miserly spell where he picked up 3 wickets as well. A lot depended on Morgan who came in late to take England across and he did it in style.,England won by 6 wkts,T20,India vs England,2
"India will look back at the last two overs which went for 38 runs. Apart from that, there was nothing much to separate between the teams. Except Kohli, all the recognised batsmen got going and looked like playing a big knock while they were in the middle. Yuvraj and Raina played gorgeous strokes, but got out at crucial junctures. Dhoni got the crowd going with 4 sixes, but hit one straight to the fielder. Indeed that was the story of the innings as most of the batsmen gifted away their wickets. For England, it was off-spinner James Tredwell who was a revelation as he brought up his best ODI figures. Dernbach was costly, but picked up the big wicket of Dhoni.",England won by 9 runs,ODI,India vs England,5
"Ravindra Jadeja had a day to remember. He contributed with bat, ball and on the field to help India to a big win. The England chase never really got going. Bhuvaneshwar Kumar was the star early on. His 10 over spell right at the top ensured that England were always on the backfoot. On a track that was aiding the spinners, his spell of 3/30 was worth its weight in gold. Kevin Pietersen was the only batsman who looked in any sort of comfort but after his dismissal the Indian spinners got stuck in and never let the pressure off.",India won by 127 runs,ODI,India vs England,3
"It has been a professional batting performance from India. Rohit Sharma surprised one and all by responding to his skipper's call. He played a lot of wonderful strokes and missed out on a well-deserved hundred, courtesy a poor decision. England will rue the missed chance when Raina was caught at slip, but Finn had knocked off the bails and it was called a dead ball. Raina was on 42 then and it could have been the turning point. As far as the England bowling is concerned, it was Tredwell again who chipped in with the wickets. But Dernbach and Bresnan could do little. Except Finn, all the bowlers were expensive which did not help.",India won by 5 wkts,ODI,India vs England,3
"This win will restore some pride for England. Ian Bell was clinical in the chase. India fought hard with the ball. Ishant Sharma, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar and Ravindra Jadeja were impressive but the score was just not big enough to defend. The game was heading for a tight finish going into the last 10 overs but the dominant stand between Eoin Morgan and Ian Bell sealed it for England. They will be elated to go home on a winning note.",England won by 7 wkts,ODI,India vs England,3
"A straightforward win for the hosts despite missing many of their batting stars. A superb century from Hughes and outstanding batting efforts from Bailey and Hussey set them up for a huge score on the board. The bowlers then stood up, Tharanga and Mahela were dismissed cheaply, Dilshan and Chandimal steadied the ship before the calamitous run-out of Dilshan started the slide. Chandimal fought bravely for his 73 but got zero support at the other end. Australia go to Adelaide with a 1-0 lead.",Australia won by 107 runs,ODI ,Australia vs Sri Lanka,3
"Kushal Perera and Dilshan started the chase off well but they stuttered when the spinners came on to bowl. Doherty and Maxwell stifled the scoring rate as they picked up wickets at regular intervals. However, Mathews steadied the ship and Thisara Perera supported him well. Thisara finished off the game with a couple of sixes to help Sri Lanka go 1-0 up in the two match series.",Sri Lanka won by 5 wkts,T20,Australia vs Sri Lanka,2
A nail-biting game this. The revised target seemed to favour Australia but Sri Lanka's bowlers held their nerves and clinched the win. Bailey and Marsh got a few boundaries and took Australia to the last over. Glenn Maxwell hit consecutive fours and threatened to take the game away but he couldn't quite finish on a high.,Sri Lanka won by 2 runs ( D/L method),T20,Australia vs Sri Lanka,4
"An utterly dominant show from the hosts. The visitors never really arrived for the game. The batting was a huge let down and even though the bowlers showed some spirit, it was never going to be enough. After the loss of an early wicket, du Plessis, the first time skipper played a matured knock. Debutant, Quinton de Kock, got into his stride as well and it should give him some confidence that he stayed on till the end.",South Africa won by 8 wkts,T20,South Africa vs New Zealand,2
"Almost a one man show, that. New Zealand's innings was all about Guptill. Nicol and Brendon McCullum played their part and gave good support to Guptill as he flayed the South African attack. He hit as many as six 6s and was particularly harsh on the spinners - Peterson and Phangiso. The wet ball made it even more difficult for the Protea bowlers but they missed a few chances as well. In the end, it was a well deserved victory for New Zealand.",NZ won by 8 wickets (D/L method),T20,South Africa vs New Zealand,2
The visitors were never in the chase after Guptill and Brendon McCullum got out. Franklin was probably their last hope but even he did not inspire any confidence. The Proteas fielded like tigers and their catching was of the highest standard. Mclaren and Phangiso were the pick of the bowlers with 3 wickets each. With that South Africa win the 3 match T20I series 2-1.,South Africa won by 33 runs,T20,South Africa vs New Zealand,2
"Phew. What a chase this has been. New Zealand got off to a horrid start as the top order once again capitulated. BJ Watling and Brendon McCullum got going thanks to a gritty partnership. However, in the middle overs, they once again stuttered before Nathan McCullum played a nice cameo. The 47 run stand for the 9th wicket between Kyle Mills and James Franklin got NZ closer to the target. In the end, Mitchell McClenaghan managed to survive and Franklin scored the winning runs as they won the first ODI at Paarl by one wicket.",New Zealand won by 1 wkt,ODI,South Africa vs New Zealand,4
"New Zealand have fought admirably. Credit to them for keeping up the pressure and bowling and fielding brilliantly. They have proven yet again that catches and sharp fielding can help win you a match. But it has to be said that it was South Africa's match to lose. They were 167/1 at one stage, cruising along with Smith and Colin Ingram at the crease. But thanks to 5 run outs, they eventually fell 27 run short. Mills was the pick of the NZ bowlers with 2/28 in 9 overs, while Nathan McCullum and Guptill impressed in the field. The visitors win the series 2-0 with one ODI to go.",New Zealand won by 27 runs,ODI,South Africa vs New Zealand,3
"It was a see-saw battle all the way today. 261 wasn't an easy target but South Africa got a very good start. Smith led the chase with a century but wickets kept falling around him. South Africa looked safe until Smith was there but once he went, New Zealand pounced on the opportunity. However, a dramatic finish courtesy Ryan McLaren ensured that South Africa wouldn't 'choke' again.",South Africa won by 1 wkt,ODI,South Africa vs New Zealand,4
"Yet another India vs Pakistan thriller. What a roller-coaster ride in just a span of 20 overs. 134 wasn't too big a target but Bhuvneshwar Kumar bowled a stunning spell on debut to send panic waves through the Pakistan camp. Pakistan were 12/3 at one stage, but Pakistan's skipper Hafeez and the experienced Shoaib Malik calmed them down with some steady batting, before going on the attack towards the end. Things turned again towards the end as India got a couple of quick wickets, but Malik stayed calm and took them through.",Pakistan won by 5 wkts,T20,India vs Pakistan,3
A cracking game of cricket and India deservedly level the series 1-1. Pakistan started off well and were kept in the hunt by some exceptional batting from their skipper Hafeez but Dinda ensured that India didn't have to worry by taking care of three crucial wickets.,India won by 11 runs,T20,India vs Pakistan,4
Pakistan take a 1-0 lead in the series. Deservingly too. India did well to fight back from some tight situations. Dhoni did it with the lower order when they batted. Bhuvaneshwar Kumar led the way with the ball. They would lay some blame on a crucial umpiring error when Jamshed was adjudged not out on 24. Ashwin was guilty of overstepping and missed out on a wicket in the process. Yuvraj dropped Jamshed on 68. There was a flicker of hope for India when Ishant Sharma sent back Misbah-ul-Haq but Shoaib Malik steadied the ship. Jamshed went past his second ODI ton and helped Pakistan coast to a win.*,Pakistan won by 6 wkts,ODI,India vs Pakistan,4
"India's bowlers and fielders delivered the win. 168 wasn't a great score on this track but the fielders made it look like a score close to 200. There were a couple of missed chances - Dhoni dropped Misbah off Jadeja and Rahane dropped Hafeez off Ashwin, but those were rare blemishes on an otherwise great day on the field for India. Young Shami Ahmed and Bhuvneshwar Kumar set it up with a superb spell at the top, and the bowlers who followed just continued. Jadeja's 1/19 from 10 overs, Ishant's 3/36 and Ashwin's 2/47 say that it was a great teamwork from the bowlers.",India won by 10 runs,ODI,India vs Pakistan,5
The Man of the Match award went to Pujara but a lot of credit should go to Ojha as well. He was brilliant right through the game and ended up with 9 wickets in the match. India's pacers outshone their England counterparts as well. Umesh and Zaheer didn't get much out of the track but they troubled the batsmen with reverse swing. Spare a thought for Cook as well. He played a marathon knock but it wasn't enough to save the game.,India won by 9 wkts,Test,India vs England,4
"A straightforward win for the hosts despite missing many of their batting stars. A superb century from Hughes and outstanding batting efforts from Bailey and Hussey set them up for a huge score on the board. The bowlers then stood up, Tharanga and Mahela were dismissed cheaply, Dilshan and Chandimal steadied the ship before the calamitous run-out of Dilshan started the slide. Chandimal fought bravely for his 73 but got zero support at the other end.",Australia won by 107 runs,ODI,Australia vs Sri Lanka,2
It was a hard fought match but Sri Lanka came up well short. Philip Hughes' hundred proved to be a big difference in the end. Sri Lanka never had one batsman to hold an end up. Mahela Jayawardene promised much but fell too quickly. Mathews waged a lone battle for some time but it was not enough. Mahela will look back at his decision to bowl first too. It was definitely harder to bat as the game progressed. The Australian bowlers mixed it up very well. Xavier Doherty stood out and his 3 wickets broke the spine of the Sri Lankan batting.,Australia won by 32 runs,ODI,Australia vs Sri Lanka,2
"Pakistan have demolished South Africa here. The Proteas got off to a solid start as they raced to 50 in five overs. AB de Villers unfurled his Vil-Scoop and looked set to take the game away from Pakistan. Umar Gul came into the attack and he changed the complexion of the game. He took four wickets in seven balls as South Africa collapsed. The other bowlers, especially Mohammad Hafeez, ran through the tail and in the end, Pakistan have emerged victorious by a margin of 95 runs.",Pakistan won by 95 runs,T20,South Africa vs Pakistan,4
"A captain's knock from Misbah. He led the chase with his usual calmness and with a cool head. Hafeez gave them a decent start and Younis and Malik put together vital stands with Misbah. The match was set up by the bowlers though, and Pakistan will travel to the Wanderers on an even kneel. The South African bowlers toiled hard, but were let down by the batsmen as well as a wet ball.",Pakistan won by 6 wkts,ODI,South Africa vs Pakistan,2
"So a fantastic game of cricket comes to an end. Pakistan fought well throughout their innings but were just not good enough on the day, maybe a couple of more wickets in hand could have got them past the line. They got off to a good start with Mohammad Hafeez batting sensibly alongside Kamran Akmal before suddenly losing their way. Shahid Afridi raised hopes with a quickfire knock. Wahab Riaz batted really well but ran out of partners as Dale Steyn led the Proteas bowling line up with good support from the rest of the bowlers. Eventually they held their nerve to go 2-1 up in the 5-match series.",South Africa won by 34 runs,ODI,South Africa vs Pakistan,3
"The Durban jinx continues for the hosts. The bowlers fought hard but were let down by a below par score and their own profligacy with the extras. They had the visitors in trouble at 33/3 before a superb 153 run stand between Misbah and Farhat led Pakistan on the recovery path. Both batsmen missed out on their tons, Pakistan endured nervy times as usual before limping past the winning post.",Pakistan won by 3 wkts,ODI,South Africa vs Pakistan,3
"A complete hammering. West Indies just didn't turn up today. Only 33.1 overs were bowled today, which is less than a complete T20 game! This should completely demoralise the visitors. They were bowled out for just 70 in under 24 overs and Australia had no problems getting to the target. Glenn Maxwell had some fun in the middle and slogged his way to a half century, but the star of the day is undoubtedly Starc. His 5 for 20 completely blew away West Indies.",Australia won by 9 wkts,ODI,Australia vs Windies,2
"A convincing win in the end for Australia. Starc was the chief destroyer once again, picking up 5 wickets. He rocked the visitors early with 3 wickets. Powell resisted well with a wonderfully crafted 83, he was well supported by Dwayne Bravo who made an attractive 45. The duo added 126 runs for the 4th wicket but the visitors collapsed once Powell fell.",Australia won by 54 runs,ODI,Australia vs Windies,3
" 330 was a huge target but West Indies were in the game for a large part of the chase. The Bravos put on a century stand and set up a very good platform but the big hitters couldn't do much. Gayle failed, Pollard was run out, and that left a bit too much for the likes of Russell and Sammy. For Australia, it was Faulkner who was the pick of the bowlers. His double strike in the 38th over took the life out of the West Indies chase.",Australia won by 39 runs,ODI,Australia vs Windies,2
"A comfortable victory for Australia in the end. Their batsmen set it up led by the Man of the Match, Adam Voges. The chase was never going to be easy but West Indies began in earnest. Until the halfway point they were well and truly in the game. Johnson Charles' streaky 100 and Pollard's watchful innings gave them hope but neither could last till the end.",Australia won by 17 runs,ODI,Australia vs Windies,3
"Well with a mammoth score of over 200, the scoreboard pressure will always be telling on the side that is chasing. That was the case here as well as New Zealand, though for a brief moment looked like they were in the hunt, could never really build solid partnerships. Balls being skied to the fielder and credit to the England bowlers as well for banging the ball in and generating extra bounce. In the end skipper Stuart Broad led from the front with a four wicket haul and that pretty much sums up a fantastic day for England. ",England won by 40 runs,T20,New Zealand vs England,2
"New Zealand finish a superb win over the visitors after a blitzkreig by their skipper Brendon McCullum. England never looked in the game and struggled against the pace, bounce and swing of the pacers. Franklin came in at the end to sneak in a career best 4 wicket haul. If not for Buttler, England might not have even reached 100.",New Zealand won by 55 runs,T20,New Zealand vs England,2
"A convincing win for England after they lost the first match. They bowled well collectively, with Anderson leading the pack with a fifer. Chasing 270, they got off to a solid start with the skipper leading from the front with a solid half century. They lost the openers in the middle overs, but Trott and Root stitched a match winning partnership of 121 runs for the 3rd wicket. Root particularly impressed one and all with his range of shots and stayed unbeaten on 79 till the end.",England won by 8 wkts,ODI,New Zealand vs England,3
"England have dominated the whole match. After the bowlers put up a clinical performance, the batsmen played with a lot of maturity. Ian Bell started off well but fell in the pursuit of quick runs. Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott shared a steady 67 run stand before Tim Southee sent both Trott and Cook back. Eoin Morgan batted aggressively to get England closer to the target, before Joe Root scored the winning runs. For New Zealand, only Southee and Andrew Ellis bowled well but the rest of the bowling lacked penetration.",England won by 5 wkts,ODI,New Zealand vs England,2
"So the West Indies take a 1-0 lead in this 3-match series. Zimbabwe were never really in the hunt, their top-order was blown away very quickly and ever since then there was no recovery from them even though malcolm Waller registered his 4th ODI fifty. Sunil Narine bagged three wickets, while Dwayne Bravo and Andre Russell bagged two each.",West Indies won by 156 runs,ODI,Windies vs Zimbabwe,1
"A clinical performance from West Indies has helped them win the 3-match series 3-0. Chasing a below par total of 212, they got off to a cautious start, but lost Sarwan early. But Darren Bravo played the sheet anchor role and stayed unbeaten on 72 till the end to see them through. Powell gave him a good company, but was again out to a loose shot. Mutombodzi and Mushangwe bowled well for Zimbabwe, but they didn't have a good total to defend.",West Indies won by 5 wkts,ODI,Windies vs Zimbabwe,2
"Yet another comfortable win for the West Indies, Zimbabwe were never really in the hunt, wickets at regular intervals pegged them back big time as the hosts swept the series 2-0.",West Indies won by 41 runs,T20,Windies vs Zimbabwe,1
"After all the drama with the floodlights, the second innings started and it was going only Sri Lanka's way. Janith Perera and Tillakaratne Dilshan started off with a bang and were going over ten runs per over. But even as the former departed, Dilshan combined well with Kumar Sangakkara and went onto make his 12th ODI hundred. In the end Sri Lanka registered an emphatic 8-wicket win as they eclipsed the D/L target with 32 balls to spare.",Sri Lanka won by 8 wkts,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh,2
"What a match it turned out to be in the end after being interrupted by the rain and at one stage it looked like it will be called off. Chasing a revised target of 183, Bangladesh got off to a good start, but soon lost wickets in a heap. But Nasir held his nerve and stayed till the end to clinch a series levelling win for them. Sri Lanka fought hard, but the efforts of Malinga and Senanayake was not enough in the end to bring them back into the game.",Bangladesh won by 3 wkts,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh,3
"So Sri Lanka hold onto their No.1 ranking in T20Is for this year. In the end, Bangladesh did well to come close to the Sri Lankan total and this was also their highest total batting second in T20Is. 199 was always going to be a tough chase, but Ashraful started off well with some big hits. Soon they lost wickets in a heap and once again it was Rahim who brought them back to the game with a responsible knock. Some tight bowling towards the end by the Sri Lankan bowlers made it difficult for Bangladesh and they fell short by 17 runs.",Sri Lanka won by 17 runs,T20,Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh,4
"A convincing win in the end for Bangladesh after they survived a top order failure to post a decent score. Bangladeshi seamers bowled a tight line and length to rip through the Zimbabwean top order, with only Taylor and Masakadza brothers offering some resistance. Ziaur Rahman was the wrecker-in-chief claiming his maiden 5-wicket haul to trigger the Zimbabwean collapse. But the credit must go to Nasir Hossain, who bailed Bangladesh out with a responsible knock after they were struggling at 94/4.",Bangladesh won by 121 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh,3
"An easy win for Zimbabwe in the end, sets up the decider on Wednesday. They bowled well to restrict Bangladesh for a decent total and also overcame a late onslasught by Razzak, who notched up a fastest fifty. They lost wickets initially, but Taylor and Williams' partnership got them back to the game, with Williams staying unbeaten till the end to help them level the series. Waller also supported him well and they romped home easily in the end winning by 6 wickets.",Zimbabwe won by 6 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh,2
"What a turnaround for Zimbabwe after they were beaten badly in the 1st ODI by 121 runs. Their batsmen clicked as a unit in both the ODIs they have won and that helped them take the 3-match series 2-1. They bowled well initially as they were boltered by the addition of Vitori. He gave them a good start and struck twice in 2 balls to leave Bangladesh struggling. Mahmudullah's late onslaught helped them to post 247. Zimbabwe started the chase in an aggressive fashion, but lost Masakadza and Taylor in quick succession. But Sibanda played a dream innings and also posted his 2nd ODI ton in the process to help Zimbabwe win the match quite easily. Williams also chipped in with a quick-fire fifty and ensured Zimbabwe didn't face any further hiccup. ",Zimbabwe won by 7 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh,3
"Brilliant win for Zimbabwe! Who would have thought they will win this one? At one stage, Bangladesh were cruising with Shakib and Shamshur on a rampage. But one over from Utseya changed it all and it all went downhill from there. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals, Mushfiqur had almost carried them home but he was caught off the first ball of the final over and it was all over for the visitors.",Zimbabwe won by 6 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh,5
"Fantastic win for Bangladesh! They batted well to reach a competitive score and then bowled brilliantly to confound the hosts. Zimbabwe kept losing wickets at regular intervals and never really looked in control of the game. Shakib bowled a remarkable spell, he picked up Taylor and Shingi and then cleaned up the tail as well. Spinners did the job for the visitors to reduce Zimbabwe to 9 wickets. In the end, a comprehensive win for Bangladesh as they square the T20 series 1-1.",Bangladesh won by 34 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs Bangladesh,2
"A comprehensive victory in the end. England never looked like they would chase this score down. Only Trott stood amongst the ruins and compiled a century, but the match was lost way before that. New Zealand were professional with the ball and took all their chances in the field. They have now got a 2-0 series lead and will look for a whitewash at Trent Bridge.",New Zealand won by 86 runs,ODI ,England vs New Zealand,2
"New Zealand would be thinking about their last five overs with the ball and the middle-order collapse with the bat. Guptill started off on a positive note, but the visitors suddenly lost track of their chase. England did really well to put pressure on the New Zealand batsmen with some fine bowling. In the end, it was too much for Taylor as he ran out of partners. ",England won by 34 runs,ODI,England vs New Zealand,2
"What a game of cricket we've had tonight. England were right in the chase from the word go. Openers Lumb and Hales got them off to a blazing start. Luke Wright continued the good work and got to his fifty. But the visitors chipped in at regular intervals to keep a check on the run flow. It was down to 35 from the last 3 overs thanks to a cameo from Bopara. But he was left stranded at the other end as Nathan McCullum, Ian Butler and Corey Anderson did the job for the Kiwis in the final overs and helped their side take an unassailable 1-0 lead in the 2-match T20I series.",New Zealand won by 5 runs,T20,England vs New Zealand,5
"What an amazing match this turned out to be in the end. There were lots of stoppages due to rain in the 1st innings and the match was reduced to 47 overs. Despite a tough D/L adjusted target, Ireland fought well, thanks to a superb century from Stirling and some amazing hitting by Kevin O'Brien helped them come closer to the Pak total and they just prevailed in the end by 1 run. Pakistani bowling was horrible and even their experienced spinner, Ajmal went for 71 runs in his 10 overs.",Match tied (D/L method),ODI,Ireland vs Pakistan,5
"Chris Gayle has once again stolen the show at his home ground with a power-packed display. His 115 run stand with Johnson Charles laid the foundation for their win. Gayle notched up his 21st ODI century and his first against Sri Lanka. Although the Lankans came back with a couple of quick wickets, West Indies were firmly in the driver's seat and they managed to seal victory with a bonus point as they chased the target down in less than 40 overs.",West Indies won by 6 wkts,ODI,Windies vs Sri Lanka,5
"Kudos to West Indies. They did a great job of restricting the strong Indian batting line-up to an average score. Later, thanks to Charles, their innings went through smoothly before a few brain fades made the match interesting. The birthday boy Kemar Roach kept his cool and played calmly to escort his side to safety. India will not exactly be displeased with this act. Despite the absence of their skipper MS Dhoni, they battled hard, led by the aggressive Virat Kohli who rotated his bowlers and fielders admirably.",West Indies won by 1 wkt,ODI,Windies vs India,4
"India showed no intent whatsoever in this chase. By the end of 10 overs, India were crawling around at a run-rate just under three. They kept on losing wickets and only Ravindra Jadeja showed some character with an unbeaten 49. Herath and Senanayake chipped in with wickets at crucial intervals as Sri Lanka rounded off the perfect day in style. ",Sri Lanka won by 161 runs,ODI,India vs Sri Lanka,1
"Kohli has registered his first win as skipper. West Indies were already on the back foot when the rain delay shelved some overs off. Chasing 274 for an unlikely win and 219 to deny India the bonus point, Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma ripped through the middle order. Roach and Narine delayed the inevitable with a 58 run stand but Jadeja took the remaining wickets to seal a massive 102 run victory. India's victory has given them the bonus point and the tournament is now wide open.",India won by 102 runs (D/L Method),ODI,Windies vs India,2
"West Indies started off very slowly as Eranga and Mathews bowled with discipline. However, a 123 run stand between Simmons and Darren Bravo gave West Indies some hope with both batsmen notching up gritty half centuries. However, with their departures, West Indies fell behind but they ensured Sri Lanka did not concede the bonus point. Mathews was the star for Sri Lanka with 4/29 as his team performed admirably.",Sri Lanka won by 39 runs (D/L method),ODI,Windies vs Sri Lanka,2
"India were coasting at 139/3 with Rohit Sharma batting well. However, once he departed, India struggled to gain momentum. Herath was the chief destroyer and he snapped up Ravindra Jadeja and Ashwin in quick succession in his final over. However, Dhoni hung in there as wickets tumbled at the other end. In the last over bowled by Eranga, Dhoni was in his elements as he smashed a six, a four and then a six as India clinched a thriller by one wicket. This has been a memorable final and India's golden run in ODIs continues.",India won by 1 wkt,ODI,India vs Sri Lanka,5
"In the end, it was an easy victory for Scotland as they successfully defended a low total. Their bowlers struck in regular intervals and the Kenyan batsmen also fell to some poor shots. Goudie chipped in with three wickets while Drummond and MacLeod picked up two wickets each. Scotland lead the 2-match series 1-0. ",Scotland won by 35 runs,T20,Scotland vs Kenya,1
"Well, it was a one-man show all throughout the game. Shahid Afridi, on his comeback, first bailed the side out of trouble with the bat, and with the ball, he was near unplayable accounting for 7 wickets. If one thought Pakistan batted very badly, the West Indies reply was even poor. None of the batsmen got going and eventually they succumbed to pressure. Afridi now has the second best bowling figures in an ODI. Pakistan go 1-0 up in the 5-match series.",Pakistan won by 126 runs,ODI ,Windies vs Pakistan,2
"So West Indies have managed to square the series here with 3 games to go. This looks like a bat first pitch. Pakistan were victorious in the first game. West Indies made a decent score today and more importantly, they bowled really well upfront. Pakistan were never really allowed to be free. Nasir Jamshed was given 4 lives but he could not make the most of it. Umar Akmal was the only other successful batsman for the visitors. Narine was the pick of the bowlers and he strangled them with 4 wickets. In the end, West Indies have managed a comprehensive win.",West Indies won by 37 runs,ODI,Windies vs Pakistan,1
"Phew! What a game of cricket. It had everything in it. The game was boring when Samuels and Bravo could never really get going and after a flurry of wickets it got interesting. One thought Pakistan pulled off a fine win but they were denied by Holder and more importantly, Umar Akmal himself. West Indies would have backed themselves to chase down 230 on a decent batting strip. They lost Gayle, Charles and Darren Bravo early. Simmons and Samuels steadied the ship before both were dismissed. Pressure got the better of Dwayne Bravo, Pollard and Sammy who went in quick succession. It was down to 15 runs needed off the last over. Holder held his nerve and hit a boundary and then a stunning six before Akmal grabbed attention on the final ball by missing a relatively easy run-out.",Match tied,ODI,Windies vs Pakistan,5
"The rain has brought in some luck with it for Pakistan. They were not doing that great before the rain break at 17 overs, but once play restarted they were outstanding. Pakistan needed 121 in 14 overs. With 8 wickets in hand, one would back the batting side. Hafeez and Misbah scored fifties to keep the run rate in check. In the end, Umar Akmal finished the game off with 6 balls remaining hitting a flurry of boundaries in the penultimate over. ",Pakistan won by 6 wkts (D/L Method),ODI,Windies vs Pakistan,3
"Pakistan kept a healthy scoring rate but lost wickets at regular intervals. However, Umar Amin stepped up and scored runs at will. His 47 laid the base for Pakistan's march towards victory. Shahid Afridi also played a vital knock but he lost his wicket at a crucial time. Zulfiqar Babar struck a four and a six in the last over to seal a thrilling two wicket win for Pakistan. Gabriel's erratic bowling in the 19th over has proven to be very costly for the West Indies.",Pakistan won by 2 wkts,T20,Windies vs Pakistan,5
"Fantastic win for the hosts! This is South Africa's second biggest defeat in ODIs by runs. The Lankans were brilliant as the visitors never really got going from the start. Malinga cleaned up Ingram on the very first ball after which, Petersen, Duminy and de Villiers chipped in a few runs and it looked like the visitors were fighting back. But some clever bowling by the spinners out-foxed them and they began losing wickets at regular intervals. Sri Lanka lead the 5-match series 1-0. ",Sri Lanka won by 180 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,3
"The injury to Hashim Amla already jolted South Africa's batting line-up. Peterson fell in the first over bowled by Malinga before Petersen and Duminy strung a solid stand. However, the Sri Lankan bowlers bowled with discipline and never allowed the Proteas to get away. In the end, rain had the final say and Sri Lanka won the match by 17 runs (D/L method) to go 2-0 up in the series.",Sri Lanka won by 17 runs (D/L method),ODI ,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,2
"South Africa finally taste victory in Lankan soil against the hosts since September 2nd, 1993. The bowlers made sure that Sri Lanka struggled in the chase, Tsotsobe struck thrice in no time to reduce them to 16/3. Mahela and Chandimal added useful runs but when they were reduced to 92/6, it looked all but over. Thisara had other ideas as he smashed 35 runs from one Peterson over, but the visitors held their nerve to close out the game.",South Africa won by 56 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,3
A dominant partnership between Dilshan and Sangakkara ensured that SL won the match with a huge degree of comfort. Dilshan scored his 17th ODI hundred while Sangakkara chipped in with 91. The duo added 184 runs for the 2nd wicket and all but sealed the victory for the hosts. South Africa did not go for a review when Duminy trapped Sangakkara plumb in front very early in the piece and they paid a heavy price for it. Sri Lanka go 3-1 ahead and deservingly so.,Sri Lanka won by 8 wkts,ODI,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,3
"A comfortable win for Sri Lanka in the end. With the series lost, they came out firing and put the South African players under huge pressure. Dilshan led from the front and it was apt that he finished things off. Mahela was the ideal foil for him, but SA clawed back in the middle overs only for Thisara to ease the hosts past the winning post. ",Sri Lanka won by 6 wkts,T20,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,2
"A comprehensive victory for the Indians. The openers got starts but failed to build on. Virat Kohli scored his 2nd ton as captain in just 4 matches and was well supported by debutant Ambati Rayudu as the visitors chipped away at the target. Kohli and Rayudu helped himself to a half century to seal India's dominance. Kohli and Raina fell towards the end, but the match was all but decided by then. India go 1-0 ahead and continue their winning streak.",India won by 6 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs India,3
"Yet another comprehensive performance from India. Shikhar Dhawan set the tone with a fine albeit chancy century. In the reply, Zimbabwe got off to a solid start. Vusi Sibanda and Hamilton Masakadza started confidently but once these two fell the innings just fell apart. Zimbabwe were then just trying to play out the 50 overs. They managed to do that. For India, Unadkat had a very good day. He picked up 4 wickets and ran out Taylor as well. ",India won by 58 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs India,3
Virat Kohli led from the front yet again and helped India to their 3rd straight win of the tournament. This win was set up by the bowlers. Zimbabwe lost wickets at regular intervals and never got going. The target of 184 was never going to be enough to trouble India. The start was solid and Kohli stayed through till the end to guide his team to a comfortable win.,India won by 7 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs India,2
"Easy win in the end for the Indians. The result was never in doubt once they bowled Zimbabwe out for 144. Cheteshwar Pujara failed to make the most of his opportunity at the top of the order as he was bowled by Chatara for just 13. Rohit Sharma scratched around but made sure that he did not throw his wicket away. Raina, promoted to No. 3 made the most of the chance as the duo scripted an impressive partnership. India now go 4-0 up and will look to complete the whitewash when the two teams meet on Saturday.",India won by 9 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs India,2
"Another routine win for India and they take the series 5-0. After a fine start given by Dhawan, Jadeja slowed things for a while before accelerating alongside Rahane. In the end, Jadeja batted through and ensured a comfortable win for his side. Zimbabwe will be really unhappy with their show in the series.",India won by 7 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs India,2
"An easy win for Pakistan in the end. The hosts started off well with Masakadza and Sibanda puttting up a 53-run opening stand. But, Anwar Ali trapped Masakadza in the 8th over and it all went downhill from there. The spinners were exceptional and quick strikes pegged back Zimbabwe as their scoring rate decreased. Taylor's fightback at one end was not enought as they needed 32 off the final over. Tanvir made sure he bowled a disciplined line to give the visitors a comfortable 25-run victory in the first match.",Pakistan won by 25 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,2
"Clinical performance by the visitors as they clinch the two match T20I series. After putting up a competitive total on the board, they were brilliant with the ball as well. The hosts started off well but stumbled in the middle overs as the Pakistani spinners stole the day. Hafeez, in particular, was fantastic as he picked up 3 important wickets. This is the 13th bilateral T20 series win for Pakistan, the most by any team.",Pakistan won by 19 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,3
"What a clinical performance from Zimbabwe. They end the 15 year winless drought against Pakistan. Last time they won a match against Pakistan in ODIs was way back in 1998. Chasing a decent total, they got off to a solid start and the opening pair put on 107. Masakadza gave them a fantastic start and was unlucky to miss out on a century as he got out for 85. Taylor found some form at a crucial time and Williams played a blinder at the end to see them through without much fuss.",Zimbabwe won by 7 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,3
A late collapse hurt the Zimbabweans. They looked good to take the fight to the Pakistan camp when Taylor and Waller were batting together. Taylor was dismissed by Ajmal and Waller was castled by Junaid. The tail fell apart and the visitors completed a crushing victory. Junaid was the best bowler on view and he deserved all the accolades.,Pakistan won by 90 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,22
"A clinical performance from Pakistan and they take the series 2-1. They had not won a series for the past 10 years which was levelled at 1-1 or 2-2, but they have broken that. They were put into bat and they struggled hard to reach a decent total. In the end Misbah bailed them out with a fighting fifty. Zimbabwe started their chase pretty well, but lost back to back wickets of Masakadza and Taylor in quick sucession, which dented their hopes. Almost all Pakistani bowlers chipped in with wickets and Zimbabwe never really looked like chasing down the total.",Pakistan won by 108 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,3
"A comprehensive win in the end for Australia. After being put into bat, Finch gave them a dream start and whatever he connected went out of the park and he ended up hitting the highest ever individual score in T20Is. Chasing 249 was always a tough ask, but England started the chase on a perfect note, but lost 3 wickets in space of 2 overs which derailed their chase. Root once again played a wondeful innings despite getting hit on the grill. In the end the Australian bowling proved to be the game changer as they used the yorkers frequently. Bopara also played a fine hand, but the pressure got to him eventually.",Australia won by 39 runs,T20,England vs Australia,4
"Comprehensive victory in the end for England. It was a tough chase for the visitors, they lost Finch and Watson early. Warner led the chase with a spirited half century, but it all went downhill once he was dismissed. Maxwell did his best towards the end, but it was always a steep chase. Dernbach was the best England bowler and he ended up with three wickets.",England won by 27 runs,T20,England vs Australia,4
A comprehensive win for Australia in the end. Chasing 362 was always a tough ask. Australian bowlers struck at regular intervals to make matter even worse for Scotland. Johnson was the pick of the bowlers taking 4 for 36.,Australia won by 200 runs,ODI,Scotland vs Australia,3
"A clinical performance from Australia has helped them win this one quite easily. This is also their first win in an ODI against England since 2011. Put into bat, they posted a huge total on the board, thanks to Clarke's first ODI ton against England. Their bowlers then responded well with some accurate bowling. Mitch Johnson was at his best today and consistently bowled at over 93 MPH to trouble the English batsmen. Only Pietersen, Morgan and Buttler excelled with the bat, with rest of the batsmen falling to some poor strokes.",Australia won by 88 runs,ODI,England vs Australia,4
"A fantastic knock from Jos Buttler has helped England level the series 1-1. England were left floundering at the start when Clint McKay's hat-trick left the hosts at 8/3. It was tough going for Morgan and Carberry as they looked to rebuild the innings. However, after they got their eye in, they played some wonderful strokes and registered gritty fifties. The 104-run stand was broken by Watson who accounted for Morgan. However, some positive strokeplay from Buttler and some help from Stokes ensured England won this match by three wickets to remain unbeaten at Swalec. For Australia, this is their fourth loss in five ODIs at this venue.",England won by 3 wkts,ODI,England vs Australia,4
Australia have some silverware to take home at the end of their long English summer. The England batsman never really got going and lost early wickets. They were in the hunt until Bopara and Buttler shared a fine partnership but the batting powerplay helped Australia as both were dismissed in quick succession. The tail wagged for a while but they had too much to do and eventually were bowled out 49 runs short. Faulkner bagged three wickets while Johnson was again outstanding with the ball and picked up two wickets.,Australia won by 49 runs,ODI,England vs Australia,3
"This is an emphatic win for Bangaldesh. They were chasing a stiff total and did well to get there with 4 balls to spare. The openers gave them a good start as they added 61 and laid the platform. Shamsur was excellent and missed out on a well deserved hundred. He was well supported by Naeem Islam. In the end the cameo from Nasir Hossain took them home. The New Zealand bowlers were finding it difficult to get regular wickets, they could not get an early wicket and were under pressure most of the time during the run chase. The jinx continues for New Zealand, they have now been whitewashed twice in three years.",Bangladesh won by 4 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs New Zealand,3
"Bangladesh's poor record in T20Is continues as they slump to their 7th loss in 8 games. Skipper Rahim kept them in the hunt after a flurry of wickets at the start. He was well supported by Naeem and Nasir but pressure got the better of them as they lost wickets at regular intervals. Mahmudullah and Gazi shared a fantastic 57-run stand for the 7th wicket and threatened to take the game away from New Zealand. But in the end, the vistors held their nerve and now they will not be going home empty handed.",New Zealand won by 15 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs New Zealand,3
"What a story Yuvraj has written for himself. This was his comeback match and he is back with a bang. India were set a challenging target and they lost Rohit early. Raina and Dhawan gave them a good start in the powerplay until both were dismissed. Kohli threw his wicket away after getting a start. But it was the Yuvraj and Dhoni partnership of 102 that took India home. The former was the aggressor as he paced his innings superbly and scored his highest T20I score, he was well aided by his skipper who played second fiddle.",India won by 6 wkts,T20,India vs Australia,4
"A comfortable win in the end for Australia. India were off to a bad start losing Dhawan very early. Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina, all started well but failed to convert it into bigger knocks. Dhoni failed for once and the lower order capitulated in the face of the mounting run-rate. Johnson was fiery in every spell and was probably the best bowler for the visitors. He was helped along very well by the rest of the bowlers as Australia take a 1-0 lead in the 7-match series.",Australia won by 72 runs,ODI,India vs Australia,2
"Excellent run chase and once again the top three batsmen set it up for the Indians. Dhawan started well, he was once again lucky tonight, dropped twice on 19 and 56, as he scored his 4th ODI hundred. He was well supported by Rohit Sharma as the pair added 178 runs for the 1st wicket. Rohit missed out on his ton, dismissed by a rank half-tracker from Finch. The stage was set for Virat Kohli. He continued with the form he showed in Jaipur as the target came down with every over, Dhawan was dismissed shortly after his hundred and India suffered a minor hiccup when the two out of form batsmen, Yuvraj Singh and Raina were dismissed in a Johnson over.*",India won by 6 wkts,ODI,India vs Australia,3
It is a comprehensive victory for Pakistan. South Africa never really got going. They kept losing wickets at regular intervals and none of the batsmen really got in. They struggled to get the spinners away. All the three spinners created all sorts of problems. Some of the batsmen got starts but no one went on to get a big one. The Pakistan bowling once again came to the rescue after their poor batting. Tanvir got the early wicket and the spinners came in and took control of the game. They were economical and took 6 wickets between them.,Pakistan won by 66 runs,ODI,Pakistan vs South Africa,2
"It has been a disciplined effort from South Africa to go 2-1 up in the series. The openers were looking good and added 50 runs for the first wicket. But it was that man again, Steyn, who came into the attack and got rid off the danger man Shehzad. They kept on getting wickets at regular intervals and once again Pakistani batsmen struggled to play Tahir, who ended up with career best figures in ODIs. There is lot to think about for Pakistan as their batsmen let them down again. Most of them got starts, but threw their wickets away. The partnership between Riaz and Tanvir looked promising but it was too late.",South Africa won by 68 runs,ODI,Pakistan vs South Africa,2
"Once again Pakistan have handed the match on a platter to South Africa from a winning position. South Africa now take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the 5-match series. Pakistan made two good changes to their side and that yielded good results for them, with both Maqsood and Junaid performing well. Maqsood looked promising and smashed his maiden fifty to bail Pakistan out of trouble. He even stitched an fruitful stand with Misbah, but his wicket triggered the collapse and Pakistan lost 5 wickets for 10 runs soon after. Umar Akmal played a fine cameo, but got out to a poor shot. Once again Misbah hung around, but the pressure got the better of him and he holed out in the deep. The visitors held their nerve at the death to pull off a fine win.",South Africa won by 28 runs,ODI,Pakistan vs South Africa,4
It is a comprehensive victory for South Africa. They never looked in trouble after they were set a mere 99 as the target. They lost Amla early but de Kock and du Plessis saw them through with no more hiccups. Both of them batted sensibly as they attacked all the other bowles except Ajmal. They paced their innings perfectly as they went after the bowling only after they were well set. ,South Africa won by 9 wkts,T20,Pakistan vs South Africa,1
"Yet another convincing performance from the Indians and once again it was the top order who set them up for this chase. Rohit Sharma looked a bit iffy at the start, but then settled down to play some fine shots. He lost Dhawan early, but Kohli was once again in his elements. They made batting look easy on what was a difficult surface. Both made fifties, with Kohli also completing 5000 career ODI runs, becoming the fastest Indian and the joint fastest along with Sir Viv Richards.*",India won by 6 wkts,ODI,India vs Windies,4
"West Indies pull off the victory and level the series 1-1. They got off to a poor start when they lost Charles and Samuels early. But Darren Bravo and Powell steadied the innings and added 100 runs for the third wicket. Both got to their fifties before throwing it away. Simmons was joined by Sammy with whom he added 82 runs for the sixth wicket. Simmons had a reprieve on 43, when Yuvraj dropped a simple catch. He then went on to score a fifty and became one of the four batsmen to do so. But it was their Test skipper, who kept his cool and took them home.",West Indies won by 2 wkts,ODI,India vs Windies,4
"This was a professional performance by the Indian batsmen. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli fell cheaply but Dhawan was in sublime form. Yuvraj Singh was an able foil, he wasn't at his best, struggling notably against Narine, but managed to fight along. The pair all but took the match out of the visitor's hands. Dhawan completed his 5th ODI hundred, Yuvraj went past fifty after a long time. Raina played a sweet little cameo while Dhoni was there to play the winning shot. For West Indies, Ravi Rampaul and Sunil Narine were exceptional with the ball, but they got no support from the rest of the bowling attack. *",India won by 5 wkts,ODI,India vs Windies,4
"A clinical win in the end for Sri Lanka and they win the rain-curtailed 2-match series 1-0. Chasing a moderate total of 143, they got off to a scintillating start with Kusal Perera firing on all cylinders. Dilshan gave him good support and allowed the youngster to call the shots. Both batsmen completed their fifties and it was Dilshan's 6th consecutive 50+ score in the T20 format. New Zealand's fielding let them down badly as they dropped Kusal twice and the ground fielding also was not up to the mark. ",Sri Lanka won by 8 wkts,T20,Sri Lanka vs New Zealand,3
It has started to rain again and the match has been called off. South Africa win by 4 runs according to D/L method. The match was poised evenly when the rain Gods interrupted. The visitors had got off to a decent start and were within par with the required run-rate. Shehzad was the first to go when he chopped a ball onto the stumps from Tsotsobe. Hafeez and Jamshed did well to stitch a partnership before the latter got out. Soon the rain intervened and they were one hit away from winning.,South Africa won by 4 runs (D/L method),T20,South Africa vs Pakistan,2
It was an all-round effort from Pakistan that helps them square the 2-match series 1-1. South Africa were once again given a good start from de Kock and Amla. The latter continued after the departure of his partner and was out just before he could get his maiden T20I fifty. Duminy played well with Miller and they put on 53 for the fifth wicket. But they were left with too many to get and some good death bowling did not help their cause as well. Afridi was the pick of the bowlers as he picked up three wickets and was well supported by Bhatti. Tanvir held his nerve to defend 17 runs in the last over and that helped Pakistan level the series.,Pakistan won by 6 runs,T20,South Africa vs Pakistan,4
"What a thriller we have witnessed just now. This is Pakistan's maiden ODI series win in South Africa. Only these two teams could have snatched defeat from the hands of victory and South Africa continue to live up to their 'Chokers' tag. Chasing a competitive total of 262, they went off to a poor start losing Smith, but Amla and de Kock steadied the ship with an 87-run partnership for the 2nd wicket. The arrival of ABD saw South Africa shift gears. The South African captain went berserk and smashed all the Pakistani bowlers all round the park. His dismissal slowed things down and pressure got to them and eventually they lost by a narrow margin.",Pakistan won by 1 run,ODI,South Africa vs Pakistan,5
"South Africa had a few hiccups but got there in the end. They got off to a flier with de Kock and Amla going all guns blazing. de Kock threw his wicket away, the spinners came in and took control of the game and didn't give any freebies. However, de Villiers was positive as kept his cool and saw his team through which he could not in the last game. Ajmal was once again the pick of the bowlers and was well supported by Rehman but they did not have enough runs on the board.",South Africa won by 4 wkts,ODI,South Africa vs Pakistan,4
"West Indies at last win a match on the tour. They huffed and puffed before getting through. McClenaghan got the hosts off to a fabulous start as he picked up four three wickets and had them reeling at 3 for 32. Dwayne Bravo and Simmons steadied the innings before the skipper was snapped up. Simmons was looking good before he poked at a wide one from Mills. But, it was Sammy who played a blinder of an innings to take them to victory. The knock of 43 came off 27 balls and he picked the right balls to attack. The Kiwi bowlers were led by McClenaghan, who picked up his first five wicket haul and continued his fine form this year. He was well supported by Mills who picked up two wickets and kept it tight at the other end.",West Indies won by 2 wkts,ODI,New Zealand vs Windies,4
"Things never really got going for the New Zealand batsmen. They all got to good starts but were unable to hold on and convert those starts into big scores. The West Indies bowlers were impeccable with their line and lengths and hit the right areas. Nikita Miller was the star with the ball as he finished with impressive figures of 4-45.West Indies have leveled the five-match ODI series 2-2. They have thrashed the hosts by 203 runs, the highest victory margin in terms of runs for West Indies against any Test playing nation.

They continued their good show with the ball as well and picked up wickets at regular intervals.",West Indies won by 203 runs,ODI,New Zealand vs Windies,4
The West Indies bowlers were not supported by their fielders. They put down four chances at the start and were sloppy throughout. Narine was once again the pick of the bowlers and was well supported by Russell. The others were not effective and went for plenty of runs.New Zealand clinch the T20I series 2-0. They started off well with Ryder going berserk but West Indies came back well to leave the hosts reeling at 5 for 79. Ronchi joined Taylor out in the middle and the duo added 68 runs for the sixth wicket. The wicket-keeper carried his fine form from the previous game to notch up his maiden T20I fifty. Taylor played the perfect second fiddle in the partnership. Neesham came down and finished things off in a hurry.,New Zealand won by 4 wkts,T20,New Zealand vs Windies,3
"An abject surrender from India. This is South Africa's second biggest victory over India in terms of runs. The last sentence sums up the night India just had. Chasing a mammoth 359 runs for victory, India got off to a tough start as they were tested by some top class fast bowling from Steyn and Morkel, with the former unlucky on numerous occasions as he went past the outside edge on a consistent basis. Kohli showed some resistance and struck some meaty boundaries, but McLaren worked him over with a peach of a delivery. Dhoni waged a lone battle and he didn't get the support from the other end. All South African seamers were amongst the wickets and India have to sort the short ball issue pretty soon as they were bounced out consistently. ",South Africa won by 141 runs,ODI,South Africa vs India,3
An excellent bowling performance hands South Africa a series victory. India got off to a horrendous start as they lost Dhawan and Kohli for a duck. Rohit and Rahane didn't last long either as they went playing some poor shots. Dhoni and Raina hung around and added 40 runs for the fifth wicket before the latter was sent packing by Philander. It was just a matter of time till the end was near. Jadeja and Ashwin prolonged the inevitable for a while before succumbing to the pace and bounce of the Proteas bowlers. The South African bowling was at its best as all the bowlers were among the wickets but Tsotsobe and Steyn were at their lethal best as they shared 7 wickets between them.,South Africa won by 134 runs,ODI,South Africa vs India,3
"An excellent comeback from Sri Lanka has helped them to retain their No.1 ranking in T20Is. After being put in by Hafeez, they went off to a cracking start and the partnership between Perera and Sanga changed the course of the game and they ended up posting a mammoth total. Chasing a huge score, Pakistan got off to a poor start losing Shehzad early and rest of the batsmen failed to stitch an useful stand and at one stage they were precariously placed at 121/8, but a fighting stand of 63 for the 9th wicket between Tanvir and Ajmal brought some hope for the home team, but Sri Lanka fought back to snare the remaining 2 wickets.",Sri Lanka won by 24 runs,T20,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,4
"So, Pakistan go 1-0 up in this 5-match ODI series with a thrilling win. One thought they had the game in their bag when Thisara Perera was dismissed in the 42nd over with Sri Lanka needing over 100 runs, but a stunning 87-run partnership between Senanayake and Prasanna spiced up things. It looked like the duo were going to pull off an unlikely win with a record 8th wicket stand for Sri Lanka against Pakistan but they couldn't quite hold their nerves in the end.",Pakistan won by 11 runs,ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,4
"Phew! An exciting game of cricket in the end as I promised at the start. Angelo Mathews has justified his decision to bowl first and Sri Lanka will be very happy with their effort today. They started the chase well before both the openers perished run-out. Sangakkara and Chandimal steadied the ship with a 94-run 3rd wicket partnership but Junaid triggered a mini collapse as he knocked over three Sri Lankan batsmen. Kulasekara raised the tempo while Mathews was just playing second fiddle to him. The duo shared a 57-run stand before Sri Lanka panicked again but in the end, they held their nerve to clinch a thrilling win. So that helps the visitors level the 5-match series 1-1 with 3 games to go. Misbah-ul-Haq wasn't happy with his side's effort as they let Sri Lanka off the hook from a winning position.",Sri Lanka won by 2 wkts,ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,5
"A comprehensive victory in the end for Pakistan. Sri Lanka were never in the chase, Gul struck twice in his 2nd over, a lot depended on Dilshan and Sangakkara, but the latter was dismissed cheaply. The rest caved in cheaply, despite a fighting fifty from Dilshan. Gul took 3 wickets, Hafeez capped a fine day with two while there were 2 each for Ajmal and Junaid. Pakistan lead the series by a 2-1 margin.",Pakistan won by 113 runs,ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,2
"An all-round display by Pakistan has helped them seal the series in the 4th ODI itself. They bowled in unison to restrict Sri Lanka under 250 and came out in an aggressive manner in the chase. Once again they lost Sharjeel early, but it was Hafeez all the way like it has been in this series so far. He notched up his 3rd ton of the series and had two important stands with Shehzad and Maqsood. He remained unbeaten till the end to see his team through to a series clinching victory. Sri Lankan bowlers were not effective and they have lot to ponder as their batting and bowling has not clicked in this series so far. ",Pakistan won by 8 wkts,ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,3
"Sri Lanka somehow managed to pull off the victory. They started off brilliantly, as Perera and Dilshan got them going with a rapid 75 runs. The latter was superb in his knock of 47, he took on all the bowlers and carted them around, he perished playing one shot too many. Dilshan and Sanga steadied the innings, before both of them went in succession. Mathews struggled to get the ball of the square, but it was the Chandimal and Mendis partnership of 40 runs that saw them through. Chandimal was mature in his innings as he took his time to settle down before playing his shots and Mendis with some big blows at the end tilted the match in favour of the visitors.",Sri Lanka won by 2 wkts,ODI ,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,4
"Phew! What a game of cricket we've had. At 120/5, Australia were down and out and hopes of England's first win on the tour were very high. Glenn Maxwell and Brad Haddin batted sensibly to add 80 runs for the 6th wicket after Shaun Marsh's fine fifty. Nathan Coulter-Nile played a good hand alongside James Faulkner after Tim Bresnan removed both Haddin and Maxwell in the same over to put the visitors on top. Faulkner was very calm at the start. Maybe he knew he could hit sixes at will after his heroics at Mohali and in the end he was proved right. The England bowlers couldn't defend 25 runs off the last 2 overs. Stokes offered some very generous length balls to help Faulkner muscle them. Bresnan didn't do a fine job in the final over either and in the end, Australia have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat.",Australia won by 1 wkt,ODI,Australia vs England,5
"It's been another clinical performance from the Aussies. England actually started the game off very well with skipper Cook batting aggressively. But when Clarke took some pace off the ball by introducing the spinners, the visitors started to lose their way. England recovered for a while in the form of Morgan and Bopara but with the Aussies getting 4 wickets for 21 runs at one stage, England were reduced to 198/8. Bresnan pushed the score past 240 with some lusty blows and gave something for the bowlers to work with.",Australia won by 7 wkts,ODI,Australia vs England,3
"With this win, Australia have ensured that England will go home empty-handed. 130 was never going to be enough on this wicket, especially against this Australian side. The bowlers did the job for the hosts initially with Hazlewood bagging 4 wickets. In reply, White started off in grand style hitting boundaries at will. Finch fell in the 6th over just before the opening stand crossed fifty. Maxwell didn't last long either as he hit one in the deep to Bresnan. But from there on, captain Bailey joined White and the duo completed their respective fifties to help Australia take a 2-0 lead in the 3-match T20I series.",Australia won by 8 wkts,T20,Australia vs England,3
"England had a daunting task and with a change in the batting-order, the openers found the going tough and perished in quick succession. A very disciplined effort from Australia meant that the batsmen had to work really hard for their runs. They also managed to pick up wickets at regular intervals and kept the run flow under check. In the end, with two wickets apiece for Coulter-Nile, Maxwell and Muirhead, Bailey's boys won the final T20I by 84 runs to make it 3-0.",Australia won by 84 runs,T20,Australia vs England,2
"An emphatic victory for the home side, they were never really in trouble as the openers gave them a flying start. India came back with a couple of quick wickets, but that brought Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson to the crease, who played sensible cricket to negate the danger posed by the spin threat of Jadeja and Ashwin. They rotated the strike and concentrated on not giving their wickets away to the spin duo. That stand set the platform and the job was duly completed by Taylor and McCullum.",New Zealand won by 7 wkts,ODI,New Zealand vs India,2
"Bangladesh were in the game until the last delivery. They got off to a flier as Tamim and Shamsur went berserk, adding 52 runs for the first wicket. Anamul continued the good start given by the openers and was ably supported by Shakib and Nasir. He went on to notch up his maiden T20I fifty and almost pulled off a thriller for his team. With 17 runs required in the last over he brought it down to 3 off the last ball. But, he could not put the full toss away which sealed the victory for Sri Lanka.",Sri Lanka won by 2 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka,5
"South Africa regained control after a poor first over from Tsotsobe with the wicket of Finch in the second over. Watson didn't last long either but Warner batted very well to smash the bowlers all over the park. A double-strike from Duminy brought South Africa back in the game again. With 28 needed off the last 2 overs, Hodge held his nerve and hit some lusty blows in the final over to take Australia home with 2 balls to spare.",Aus won by 5 wkts,T20,South Africa vs Australia,4
"A serious blow to West Indies, the World Champions. Ireland did well to restrict them to a poor total on a surface that was difficult to bat on. In reply, though getting off to a poor start, Ed Joyce dropped anchor and batted sensibly alongside Poynter. The latter fell after sharing a 50-run stand but Ed Joyce batted through and took his side home in the last over with the company of Kevin O'Brien. So this win means, Ireland take an unassailable 1-0 lead in the 2-match T20I series.",Ireland won by 6 wkts,T20,Windies vs Ireland,3
"Well Pakistan win the match with a bonus point, who would have thought about this when they were struggling at 117/6. The Afghans were on top for the first part of the game, but Umar Akmal's knock took the match away from them. While chasing, their top-order played too defensively and that put the pressure on the other batsmen. Ajmal was as-usual wily with his variations and none of the Afghan batsmen could read the doosra. Afridi bowled a mean spell and Hafeez bowled a tight line and also ended up taking 3 wickets.",Pakistan won by 72 runs,ODI,Afghanistan vs Pakistan,3
"A superb match has ended and Sri Lanka have beaten the second Asian gaints in another cliff-hanger. The top-three set up the run chase, and although the Indian middle order pulled things back, Sangakkara ensured the victory for the Sri Lankans. Thirimanne and Kusal Perera were solid at the start while Sangakkara made his 18th ODI hundred. Jadeja and Ashwin pulled things back in the middle overs, but the much haunted death bowling came back to haunt India.",Sri Lanka won by 2 wkts,ODI,India vs Sri Lanka,4
"Facing a Himalayan task, Pakistan needed a sturdy start. Shehzad and Hafeez lent that and set up the platform for Afridi to unleash mayhem on Bangladesh. The hosts did not know what hit them as Afridi produced another blast from his armoury to consign Mushfiqur's men to another heart breaking defeat. Fawad Alam was happy to play the pick-up-truck to Afridi's ferrari. Although both fell at the doorstep of victory, Umar Akmal sealed Pakistan's passage to the final.",Pakistan won by 3 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs Pakistan,3
"Al-Amin Hossain scuppered Sri Lanka's chase, snaring Kusal Perera and Sanga early. Things went from bad to worse when Thirimanne sold Mahela a dummy. But then, Angelo Mathews, borrowing the calmness of sufi saints, anchored the chase to perfection, helping Sri Lanka survive the Bangladesh scare and with it maintain their unbeaten streak in the run-up to the Asia Cup final. The spunky Chaturanga de Silva was unlucky to miss out a fifty of his own but proved the ideal foil for his skipper. ",Sri Lanka won by 3 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka,3
"A deserving win for England. They never looked like losing this game, at least until the final few overs. Ramdin fought hard, scored his first ODI ton, also became the 1st West Indian keeper-batsman to get a ODI ton. But he got very little support from the rest of his mates. The top-order imploded, each batsman following the other in throwing their wicket away. The bowling was tidy, and if not for Ramdin the margin would have been even bigger. England have comeback from being 0-1 down to register a 2-1 series win.",England won by 25 runs,ODI,Windies vs England,3
"England got off to a worst possible start. They lost Hales and Wright in successive deliveries. Lumb was looking good before the pressure of the run rate got the better of him. Morgan started postively but he too could not convert his start. Bopara and Bresnan had some late flourish but the match had already slipped out of their hands. The main concern was the way they handled the spinners. Badree, Narine and Samules shared 6 wickets between them. They were economical and didn't give away any freebies to the batsmen.",West Indies won by 27 runs,T20,Windies vs England,2
"An amazing finish in the end by Sammy after they had lost 2 wickets in 2 balls and needed 40 from 30. Sammy played a sensible hand and muscled 3 sixes to shift the momentum back towards the Carribean side. Earlier the openers had gotten them off to a strong shot with Smith and Gayle firing on all the cylinders. But England fought back well in the middle overs and Bopara bowled a lovely spell conceding just 10 runs from his 4 overs and accounting for Gayle in the process. They lost Samuels and Russell to sucessive balls, but Sammy made sure they finished off on a winning note with a blistering unbeaten innings of 30 from just 9 balls. ",West Indies won by 5 wkts,T20,Windies vs England,4
"It's been a great game of cricket. Never quite sure who's going to win the match until the final ball. West Indies got off to a poor start in the chase by losing quick wickets but Simmons steadied the ship with a gritty fifty. Ramdin too gave him good company but the latter perished in pursuit of some quick runs. Sammy and Simmons tried their level best but couldn't quite hold their nerve to get over the line. Anyway, West Indies win the 3-match series 2-1.",England won by 5 runs,T20,Windies vs England,4
"A convincing performance from Bangladesh and they have all but sealed their entry into the main rounds. The target was hardly challenging, especially with the dew around. The bowling was disciplined but they were simply helpless in front of the assault from the Bangladesh batsmen. Tamim and Anamul started well, and Shakib finished it off in style. Nepal's spinners were undone by the dew, and had no chance of defending the paltry target.",Bangladesh won by 8 wkts,T20,Bangladesh vs Nepal,1
"A convincing performance by Ireland in a match that ended in bizzare circumstances. After having restricted UAE to a modest score, they started off in a fiery fashion. Paul Stirling had to retire hurt after getting a blow on his shoulder. Ed Joyce batted in a positive fashion and was well supported by skipper, Will Porterfield. They lost a clump of wickets towards the end before the match was finished abruptly, thanks to floodlight failure as well as rain. ",Ireland won by 21 runs (D/L method),T20,Ireland vs United Arab Emirates,1
"The Nepal bowlers set the ball rolling, reducing their arch-rivals to 5-50. Then, Shafiuqllah and Shenwari culled the rot briefly with some aggressive batsmanship. Stanikzai battled hard and went down blazing. While the spinners blocked all escape routes in the middle overs, Mukhiya excelled at the death with those Malinga-like accurate yorkers. Nepal's catching was another key ingredient in their victory.",Nepal won by 9 runs,T20,Afghanistan vs Nepal,4
"Wonderful performance from Hong Kong. Irfan Ahmed started off briskly, and for a moment Rahim looked a worried man. Shakib was unplayable tonight, he and the other spinners put Bangladesh right on top. Munir Dar though had different ideas, he kept the score-board ticking with cheeky ones, twos and the occassional boundaries. They again lost their way towards the end, but Amjad was coolness personified in the final over as he completed the victory march.",Hong Kong won by 2 wkts,T20,Bangladesh vs Hong Kong,3
What a match to kick start Super Sunday! The match swung like a pendulum until Pakistan came back strongly to win it. Australia started off poorly as they lost Warner and Watson in the first over. Maxwell and Finch seemed to be playing on a different pitch as they carved the bowling to all parts of the ground. They added 118-runs for the third wicket. Maxwell in particular seemed to be in a hurry as he got his fifty off just 18 balls. He looked well on course for a hundred before throwing it away. Finch carried on even though he kept losing partners at the end. He too got to his fifty but in the end there was too much to do for him.,Pakistan won by 16 runs,T20,Australia vs Pakistan,4
"India register their third comfortable win and become the first team to enter the semis. With this win India are now the No.1 T20 side in the World. It was nicely set up by the spinners and the batsmen didn't make much fuss of the target. Dhawan could not get going as he perished early but it was once again Rohit and Kohli who added a 100-run stand, the second in as many matches to see India through. Dhoni promoted himself up the order and spent some time out in the middle. Bangladesh bowlers did not have much in the bank. They tried their best but could not restrict the two in-form batsmen from playing their shots.",India won by 8 wkts,T20,Bangladesh vs India,2
"Another solid work-out for Brendon McCullum and his men. Guptill flopped again, but the skipper took it upon himself to lead the chase. He was hampered with a bad back, but did not allow that to affect him. He was well supported by the other batsmen as the chase was completed with ease. On the other hand, Netherlands fought bravely once again, and it was only the lack of experience that did them.",New Zealand won by 6 wkts,T20,Netherlands vs New Zealand,2
"It was a clinical run-chase from Australia. They were barely troubled by the shoddy Bangladesh bowlers, who were guilty of erring on the shorter side. Warner and Finch set the tone with a massive 98-run partnership. Both batsmen finally came into their own, wading into the bowling attack. Though both Finch and Maxi fell at the doorstep of victory, Bailey and White got Australia past the finish line to leave the tournament with a win.",Australia won by 7 wkts,ODI,Bangladesh vs Australia,2
West Indies started the match only after 15 overs. Sammy and Bravo gave them a formidable total. Then the bowlers responded strongly to bowl out the opposition and register the biggest win for their side in T20Is. Badree and Narine showed why they are ranked No. 1 and 2 bowlers in T20Is. Together they picked up 6 wickets and conceded only 26 runs. The rest of the bowlers chipped in and were also well backed up in the field.  ,West Indies won by 84 runs,T20,Pakistan vs Windies,3
"Afghanistan never looked in trouble as they chased down the target. Noor Ali threw away a start but the debutant, Usman Ghani made the most of the opportunity given. He scored a well compiled 70 and the inexperience showed when he played a poor shot when there was a hundred for the taking. Shaidi and Shenwari then added a 64-run stand for the fourth wicket before Shenwari tried to hurry things up. Nabi came out and did light work of the required runs. Hong Kong bowlers were not supported in the field as they put down four catches which did not help their cause.",Afghanistan won by 6 wkts,ODI,Afghanistan vs Hong Kong,3
The UAE innings was based on two partnerships. First between Amjad and Faris who added 70 runs for the opening wicket and then between Amjad and Khurram who stitched a 86-run stand for the fourth wicket. Amjad was looking good for a hundred but fell just short by two runs. Once he got out there was no support for Khurram and he too perished after a while. The Afghan bowlers were led by Rahmat Shah who picked up his maiden five wicket haul and was well supported by the rest of his mates.,Afghanistan won by 70 runs,ODI,Afghanistan vs United Arab Emirates,2
"A disciplined bowling effort by Sri Lanka has helped them defend a low total. 219 was never enough on this track, but the Irish batsmen couldn't handle Mendis and co and lost too many wickets at the start and they could never come back into the game after that. Lakmal and Kula shared 5 wickets between them and provided good support to Mendis. There was some rain during the start of the second innings, but luckily it stayed away and we could get a full game. ",Sri Lanka won by 79 runs,ODI,Ireland vs Sri Lanka,2
"In the end, Sri Lanka hold their nerve to clinch a narrow win by 9 runs. They had England under the mat in the middle overs, but leaked too many runs towards the death and Bopara ignited some hope for England with some lusty blows. However, the Sri Lankan bowlers bowled well at the death and ensured SL didn't fall short. Hales was a slow starter, but he compensated for it later and struck some meaty blows. Most of the batsmen were not able to pick Malinga as the Sri Lankan captain mixed his slower deliveries well and finished with the figures of 3/28 from his 4 overs.",Sri Lanka won by 9 runs,T20,England vs Sri Lanka,4
"It has been a professional display from England in the rain-hit game. First their batsmen got the runs and set-up a huge score for the Sri Lankan batsmen to chase down. Then their bowlers responded well by taking wickets at regular intervals. The visitors never really got going with the bat, Mahela was the only one who looked good at the crease but he too perished at the wrong time. The rest of the batsmen were troubled by Jordan, who was the pick of the bowlers with 3 wickets. He was well supported by the rest of the bowlers.",England won by 81 runs (D/L method),ODI,England vs Sri Lanka,3
"West Indies have comeback well to level the series 1-1. The visitors started off well with McCullum and Williamson going berserk but once Baz fell to Badree, they lost the momentum. Pollard tightened things in the middle with his variations and once the asking rate went up, the New Zealand batsmen failed to get the big hits away. They lost their last 8 wickets for 44 runs. Narine and Badree bowled superbly, while Cottrell also did a good job. ",West Indies won by 39 runs,T20,Windies vs New Zealand,2
"Though the rain made the run chase interesting for a while, India won the game easily in the end. Uthappa and Rahane put on 99 for the first wicket before the former fell very soon after completing his fifty. There was a long rain break and once play resumed, Bangladesh's spinners got some purchase and troubled the Indian batsmen for a short while. Pujara perished immediately after the restart but Rahane continued his fine form and completed his 6th ODI fifty before Ziaur held on to a stunner to dismiss him. Raina and Rayudu then finished the formalitites, helping India to the finish line.",Ind won by 7 wkts (D/L method),ODI,Bangladesh vs India,3
"South Africa finally have the monkey off their back. Chasing 340, Sri Lanka got off to a brilliant start scoring 99 runs in the first 10 overs. Kusal Perera got off the blocks in fine fashion, Dilshan and Sangakkara followed suit. A misunderstanding caused Dilshan's exit, and that was followed by a slump. Mathews fought hard for his 58, but the match was over once he was dismissed.",South Africa won by 82 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs South Africa,2
"What a thriller! We did not know the winner until the last ball of the game. The game swung like a pendulum. England started off well, by sending Rahane back early. Then Kohli and Dhawan added 79 for the second wicket, the former scoring his first fifty of the tour. He fell just when India were in control. Dhoni and Raina tried their best but some good death bowling did not allow them to score as freely as they would have liked. The Indian skipper kept his side in the game until the final delivery, but was not able to take them past the finishing line.",England won by 3 runs,T20,England vs India,5
"A comprehensive victory for the hosts. The opening stand of Raza and Hamilton added 224 runs and made it a stroll in the park. The latter went on to bring up his maiden ODI hundred, the knock was filled with strokes on both sides of the wicket. Hamilton played second fiddle and missed out on his ton by 7 runs. Taylor then came out and finished things with ease. Afghanistan bowlers didn't have any answers to the onslaught. They kept giving boundaries on a consistent basis and never looked like taking a wicket. The visitors will have a lot to ponder about for the next game.",Zimbabwe won by 8 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,4
Afghanistan have won! What a fantastic game. It is their second ODI win against an ICC full member nation as well as their highest successful ODI run chase. The last few overs were indeed thrilling. The visitors had got off to a fiery start before losing the plot in the middle overs. But sensible batting from the skipper and a cameo by Dawlat Zadran has helped them remain alive in this 4-match series.,Afghanistan won by 2 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,4
"Afghanistan have rumbled back strongly from 0-2 down to level the four-match ODI series. After the Nabi-Shafiqullah show with the bat, the Afghanistan bowlers set the ball rolling, reducing Zimbabwe to 6-29. The story could have been more shameful for the hosts if not for a fighting 64 from Mutumbami. He was the chief aggressor in a 97-run stand with Maruma. Eventually, Zimbabwe folded for 159, giving Afghanistan a big 100-run victory. ",Afghanistan won by 100 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,3
" It's a comfortable win for Sri Lanka, they needed this to keep the series alive. Malinga removed Sharjeel early but Shehzad and Hafeez set up an attacking 96-run stand to fuel the chase. The latter in particular seemed in superb touch, essaying some lovely drives and cuts. However, the Sri Lankan spinners rallied to snatch the initiative from the visitors. The Pakistan batsmen played some rash shots and perished in the process.",Sri Lanka won by 77 runs,ODI,Sri Lanka vs Pakistan,3
"A professional performance by South Africa. They picked up three early wickets, but Williams and Hamilton Masakadza steadied the innings. The former being the aggressor, both men got to their fifties and threw it away. Once the 100-run stand was broken, Zimbabwe never seemed to go for the victory. Chigumbura was struggling with an injury to his leg, he was unable to run properly and debutant Jongwe tried his best but he too fell trying to accelerate.",South Africa won by 93 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs South Africa,2
"West Indies go 1-0 ahead. Things looked bleak at 34/5, but Ramdin and Pollard almost took them home during the course of a splendid 145-run stand for the 6th wicket. Pollard (89) was sublime and was well supported by Ramdin (74). Bangladesh envisioned fresh hopes of pulling off an upset win when both fell, but Jason Holder held his nerve to steer the hosts home.",West Indies won by 3 wkts,ODI,Windies vs Bangladesh,4
"Once the Tamim-Rahim stand was broken, Bangladesh were never really in the hunt. The asking rate pressure got the better of them and in the end West Indies have completed a massive win. 339 was chasable but the visitors didn't plan their chase properly. Anamul and Kayes played poor shots to put pressure on the rest of the batsmen. Rahim hung around but he couldn't score freely. Rampaul was the pick of the bowlers for the hosts, while the rest supported him very well.",West Indies won by 91 runs,ODI,Windies vs Bangladesh,3
"A throughly professional performace from the Australians. They batted first, started slowly and exploded in the last 10 overs. Zimbabwe had no chance in chasing the target down, but barring Hamiltom Masakadza (70), none of the other batsmen showed any aptitude. Mitchell Johnson was fast while Starc swung the ball to a nicety. The others chipped in with wickets while Steven Smith finished off the tail. Zimbabwe's coach, Steven Mongango, didn't look too plesed with his lads and the hosts have a tough job after this heavy defeat.",Australia won by 198 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Australia,2
"Zimbabwe put Australia under pressure right from the word go. In fact, it was a blessing in disguise that Clarke opted to bat first as they were keen to bowl first. Spin was introduced as early as the second over and the Australian batsmen were never comfortable at the crease. Skipper Clarke though played a sensational innings, he had to retire hurt on 68 due to his troublesome hamstring and then some lusty blows from Haddin and Cutting at the death got them past 200. Clarke came out to bat in the last over as they lost 9 wickets but he didn't face a ball.",Zimbabwe won by 3 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Australia,3
"So a comprehensive win for Australia. Warner held the innings together, despite wickets falling at regular intervals at the start, and ensured that Australia got past the line quite comfortably in the end. Raza Hasan was the pick of the bowlers, picking up 2 wickets in his 4-over spell, while skipper Afridi too got himself into the wickets column. The pacers didn't have a great time and both Irfan and Riaz went for runs.",Australia won by 6 wkts,T20,Pakistan vs Australia,2
"In the end, you would have to say that it was a comfortable 59-run win for India, even though they let West Indies score freely after picking up early wickets. When West Indies were reduced to 121/5, it looked like India were quickly going to wrap things up, but Samuels and Russell hit some lusty blows to keep the game wide open. Samuels scored his 7th ODI hundred, but the Indian bowlers managed to get the breakthroughs at the fag end to dent the visitors.",India won by 59 runs,ODI,India vs Windies,3
"It has been a clinical performance from the South Africans. They never let the New Zealand batsmen to settle down and get the momentum to chase down the target. Guptill and Neesham could not provide the start that their team would have hoped for. Latham, Brownlie and McCullum all got starts, but none could convert it into a big score. Ronchi once again was the standout with the bat. The wicket-keeper showed immense application and was not afraid to play his shots. McClenaghan supported him well and the pair added 76 runs for the last wicket. Because of that partnership there was some respectability to the final score.",South Africa won by 72 runs,ODI,New Zealand vs South Africa,2
"So New Zealand beat Pakistan for the first time in 11 ODIs at Sharjah. The series is now 1-1, with three games to go. When Devcich and Brownline shared a 103-run opening stand, it looked like the visitors were going to win by a big margin, but Pakistan bounced back strongly and reduced the visitors to 167/5. Captain Williamson though, after a sensible fifty from Devcich early on, dropped anchor and ensured that New Zealand crossed the line with 24 balls to spare. He registered his 12th ODI fifty and it was his 6th fifty in his last 7 innings. Apart from Haris Sohail, who picked up three wickets, and Afridi (2 wickets), none of the Pakistani bowlers could trouble the batsmen.",New Zealand won by 4 wkts,ODI,Pakistan vs New Zealand,4
"It's 3-2 currently in the series with two matches to go. But for the last few overs, England paced their run chase very well and it's a well deserved victory for Alastair Cook & Co. The visitors got off to a positive start, but Moeen Ali threw it away. Captain Cook hung around for a while, but the returning Sachithra Senanayake trapped him LBW. James Taylor and Joe Root then steadied the ship with a fine century partnership. Although Taylor was dismissed after his second consecutive fifty, Root carried on and registered his 3rd ODI hundred. England lost a few wickets at the end, but Buttler and Root saw them through. Apart from Senanayake, who got three wickets, none of the Sri Lankan bowlers were impressive.",England won by 5 wkts,ODI,Sri Lanka vs England,4
"It was a Chris Gayle show at Newlands. He ran amok and scored 52 runs at one stage from just 11 balls, completing a 17-ball fifty in the process, the fastest by a West Indian batsman. He looked determined to finish it off on his own. But after his dismissal, for a 31-ball 77, West Indies threatened to undermine all his work. Samuels played a good hand, making a fine 41. The visitors lost a heap of wickets towards the end, but Gayle's knock had placed them in a comfortable position. Nothing much to say about South Africa's bowling, although Tahir impressed once again. The visitors go 1-0 up in the 3-match series.",West Indies won by 4 wkts,T20,South Africa vs Windies,4
"Chasing 232, the intent was pretty clear from Smith and Gayle. Though the former perished early, Gayle bludgeoned the bowling and shared a record 152-run stand for the second wicket with Samuels. It looked like West Indies would win with three overs to spare, but Wiese brought the hosts back by removing both in quick succession. The visitors lost their way slightly as South Africa picked up 5 wickets in a space of 38 runs. However, Sammy stayed calm when it mattered and took West Indies past the line to achieve a record win. Phew! Insane stuff from the Caribbean boys!",West Indies won by 4 wkts,T20,South Africa vs Windies,5
"Scotland gave it their all in defending the paltry 216 that their batsmen put up. At one stage, they had the Irish reeling at 5/100. However, Niall O'Brien held one end up and kept going even as wickets tumbled at the other end. In the end, the elder O'Brien brother remained unbeaten on 80 and took his side home. Wardlaw was the pick of the Scottish bowlers, he was well supported by the rest, but they just didn't have enough runs on the board.",Ireland won by 3 wkts,ODI,Ireland vs Scotland,3
"The Australian bowlers were exceptional. Although Starc had an off-day, the rest of his mates stepped up. Hazlewood was outstanding with the new ball, bowling tight line and lengths, Johnson was at his fearsome best and Maxwell too varied his pace to pick up his career-best figures. The fielding too was terrific as they pulled off some stunners in the field. Overall, it was an all-round performance from the hosts. ",Australia won by 112 runs,ODI,Australia vs England,3
"New Zealand win comprehensively at the end. They got off to a blazing start with Brendon McCullum going hard at the new ball. However, he perished in the fourth over after hitting four boundaries. Guptill and Latham got together and stitched a 44-run stand before the latter departed. Guptill followed soon after and it seemed at one point that they would miss the solidity of Williamson in the middle order. However, Taylor and Elliott then took on the mantle of seeing their team through. Taylor's good form in 2015 continues and Elliott continues to justify his selection in the World Cup squad ahead of Neesham. Both registered fifties and took the hosts home. The Pakistani bowlers bowled well in patches, but nothing to really trouble the Kiwis.",New Zealand won by 7 wkts,ODI ,New Zealand vs Pakistan,3
"Another comprehensive victory for New Zealand. Pakistan started off well through Shehzad and Hafeez, who added 111 runs for the opening stand. Both batsmen got to their respective fifties before the former threw it away. Hafeez kept going, but the climbing run-rate got the better off him. Misbah came out with an attacking mindset, but didn't get any support from the other end. None of the other Pakistani batsmen tried to play themselves in as they all fell while looking for runs.",New Zealand won by 119 runs,ODI,New Zealand vs Pakistan,2
"Another comprehensive win for the Proteas. They have sealed the T20I series 2-0. Soumya Sarkar got Bangladesh off to a blazing start, Tamim struggled but stuck it out for a while before Parnell sent him packing. However, the introduction of spin brought about the downfall of the hosts. Bangladesh were never in the game once they lost Sarkar and Shakib. Leie was excellent with his leg-breaks and was well supported by Phangiso and Abbott. The trio shared 9 wickets between them. A mention should be made of the South African fielding as well as they took some terrific catches.",South Africa won by 31 runs,T20,Bangladesh vs South Africa,3
"At 97/0, Zimbabwe would have had high hopes of bagging a rare series win, but the wickets of Chamu Chibhabha, Hamilton Masakadza and Elton Chigumbura in quick succession hurt them badly. Craig Ervine and Sean Williams were involved in a brisk stand but the former ran himself out. Soon Sikandar Raza gifted his wicket away and with Regis Chakabva too following him shortly, Zimbabwe looked down and out. However, Graeme Cremer gave decent support to Williams, who was fighting hard. The left-hander also recorded a fifty but once that partnership was broken, New Zealand managed to pick wickets at regular intervals and eventually sealed the match with 14 balls to spare. Mitchell McClenaghan was the pick of the bowlers with three wickets, while Ish Sodhi bagged two.",New Zealand won by 38 runs,ODI,Zimbabwe vs New Zealand,3
"A fine all-round show by the tourists helped them to thrash Zimbabwe in the only T20I. If George Worker essayed an enterprising knock, then the bowlers picked up wickets at regular intervals to restrict the hosts to a meagre total. Adam Milne and Mitchell McClenaghan bowled with a good burst of pace to trouble the opposition ranks and made key breakthroughs. James Neesham, Ish Sodhi and Nathan McCullum were also among the wickets. Zimbabwe never seemed to be in the game after losing early wickets. Only Craig Ervine played a handy knock. New Zealand were also very good in the field. Earlier, Worker on his T20I debut, explored every nook and corner of the ground to smash a fifty. Luke Ronchi and Colin Munro notched up quick-fire cameos in the end overs.",New Zealand won by 80 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs New Zealand,2
"South Africa put up a fine all-round show to overcome the tourists in the first T20I. Hashim Amla held the innings together with a steady knock. Rilee Rossouw and AB de Villiers played breezy knocks as the hosts registered a convincing win. When van Wyk was dismissed, New Zealand had a window of opportunity, but the 50-run stand between de Villiers and Amla put the home team in command. Even though, Rossouw and Amla lost their wickets in the end, the Proteas coasted towards an easy win. Doug Bracewell, Mitchell McClenaghan, Adam Milne and George Worker picked up a wicket apiece, but they needed more from their bowlers.",South Africa won by 6 wkts,T20,South Africa vs New Zealand,2
"The players shake hands with each other and the Australian players are all smiles as they walk back. When the third wicket partnership between Niall O'Brien and Ed Joyce was growing strong, Australia were under serious pressure, but once that stand was broken, the visitors came back well to gain the upper hand. The start wasn't good for Ireland as they lost the openers inside 2 overs, but Ed Joyce and Niall O'Brien steadied the innings. There were a few rain breaks and it looked as if it was going to favour the team batting second, but Australia captured key moments to seal the contest. Nathan Coulter-Nile finished with three wickets, while Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins bagged two apiece.*",Australia won by 23 runs (D/L method),ODI,Ireland vs Australia,2
"Despite putting up a fine all-round show in the field, the hosts slipped towards a defeat. Imad Wasim starred for the visitors by picking up four wickets in his quota of four overs. On a track, where it was stopping on the batsmen, Zimbabwe struggled to counter the unremitting control of Imad. Hamilton Masakadza showed self-belief at top of the order. However, just when it felt as if, he had steadied the innings, Masakadza was dismissed by the man of the moment, Imad. Chigumbura then landed a few powerful blows and stitched a key stand with Utseya, but they had too much to do.",Pakistan won by 13 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,4
"Another abject performance with the bat from the hosts. The top-order fell in a heap and despite the best efforts of Sean Williams and Sikandar Raza, it was a mountain that proved too steep. Chigumbura struck some late blows, but it only lessened the margin of defeat. Once again, Pakistan's bowling turned out to the difference between the two teams. Imad Wasim was impressive once again and the pacers made sure that his efforts didn't go waste.",Pakistan won by 15 runs,T20,Zimbabwe vs Pakistan,3
"Miller failed to impress once again and Behardien failed to convert a start. However, de Villiers was growing strong at one end and at one stage it appeared as if he would single-handedly take the Proteas home. Soon after he completed his 22nd ODI hundred, Bhuvneshwar removed him and South Africa could never really recover from the blow. Eventually, Dhoni's boys sealed the contest by 35 runs, but the captain would have ideally wanted his bowlers to bowl the opposition out. Bhuvi bagged three wickets, while Harbhajan picked up two. Mohit, Axar and Mishra bagged a wicket each.",India won by 35 runs,ODI,India vs South Africa,4
"England didn't get to the best of starts as they lost Roy and Root inside the first six overs. Morgan and Hales held the innings together and stitched a 60-run stand for the third wicket. Hales looked good in his stay, but the 20-year old Zafar Gohar nipped him out with a lovely flighted delivery. Morgan soon followed Hales as he missed a straighter one from Malik. Once Morgan got out, it seemed as if Pakistan were right back in the game. Although Taylor and the under-pressure Buttler had a tough initial period, the duo nudged and nurdled their way to a match-winning 117 run partnership and helped England lead this 4-match ODI series.",England won by 6 wkts,ODI,Pakistan vs England,4
"225 was a tricky chase but Sri Lanka handled it pretty well and in the end won the game easily. Just like the previous game, Kusal Perera and Tillakaratne Dilshan got the side off to a great start. Sunil Narine though came on and knocked over the latter first ball with a seam-up ball that swung back in and totally deceived the batsman. Lahiru Thirmanne then joined Perera at the crease and the duo shared a massive 156-run stand for the second wicket to ensure a smooth sail for the hosts. Perera fell 1 run short of what would have been a well-deserved 3rd ODI hundred. By the time he got out, Sri Lanka were well ahead and Dinesh Chandimal and Thirmanne completed the formalities. Barring Narine, none of West Indies' bowlers were impressive.",Sri Lanka won by 8 wkts (D/L method),ODI,Sri Lanka vs Windies,3
"Zimbabwe might have taken it to the 50th over, but they were always in control of the run-chase. Mutumbami looked in good touch as he brought up his third ODI fifty. Cameo from Williams in the middle kept the scoreboard moving. Then the experienced duo of Chigumbura and Raza were calm as they took their team over the finish line. Afghanistan bowled tight line and lengths, but they did not have enough runs on the board. Amir Hamza was the pick of the bowlers as he ended with figures of 3 for 47. Another 15-20 runs would have made the match more interesting.",Zimbabwe won by 6 wkts,ODI,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,2
"The tourists played with pluck and steel to pull off a thrilling win and seal the series 2-0. Usman Ghani and Mohammad Shahzad gave them a rollicking start with an enterprising stand of 95. However, both of them fell in quick succession. Zimbabwe then clawed their way back into the game by taking wickets at regular intervals. It was Gulbadin Naib, who held the innings together with a determined effort. He remained not out and guided them home. Shafiqullah too played his part with a crucial boundary in the final over. Earlier, Sean Williams and Mutumbami had taken the hosts to a substantial total.",Afghanistan won by 5 wkts,T20,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,2
"A crushing victory for New Zealand. Brendon McCullum was off to a flier, he was well supported by Martin Guptill. The Sri Lankan bowlers didn't know what hit them. McCullum registered his fifty in 23 balls, Guptill was just slightly slower and New Zealand got their team 100 in the 9th over. Both fell but the task had been completed by then. Nicholls helped himself to useful runs as the hosts' chased down the target - with 174 balls to spare.",New Zealand won by 7 wkts,ODI ,New Zealand vs Sri Lanka,2
"A complete performance from Angelo Mathews and his men. The bowlers put up an impressive performance, restricting the hosts to a par score on this pitch. Danushka Gunathilaka was a man on a mission, belting a 45-ball 65. Dilshan was happy to play second fiddle, but took over after his partner fell. He was unlucky to be dismissed in the nervous nineties. Lahiru Thirimanne then ensured that there were no further hiccups as he took his team home, in the company of Dinesh Chandimal.",Sri Lanka won by 8 wkts,ODI,New Zealand vs Sri Lanka,2
"Riding on Luke Jongwe's 5-for, Zimbabwe thrashed their opposition ranks to script a superb turnaround and emerge victorious. With this win, Zimbabwe now trail the series 1-2. Only Mohammad Shahzad checked in a series of shots to keep the scorecard ticking for the hosts. Rest of the batsmen though, fell to Jongwe and Madziva's incisive bowling. The duo shared eight wickets between them. Earlier, Masakadaza and Cremer stitched a key century stand to help the tourists make a smart recovery after they lost a slew of wickets up front. In the end, Zimbabwe's total proved to be too much for Afghanistan.",Zimbabwe won by 117 runs,ODI,Afghanistan vs Zimbabwe,2
"Changes in the batting order didn't help the Zimbabwean cause as they got off to a disastrous start, losing five wickets in quick succession. Their innings never took off as they were reeling at 34/5 early on. Masakadza and Moor then got together for a 71-run stand, but Zimbabwe were always chasing the leather. The Zimbabwean opener got to his fifty, but both Moor and him departed soon after. It was only a matter of time before Afghanistan wrapped things up after that, which they did with the first ball of the 18th over.",Afghanistan won by 81 runs,T20,Afghanistan vs Zimbabwe,2
"The hosts were off to a flier, Warner and Finch meant business, right from the first ball. They were helped along by some ordinary bowling by Ashwin. Bumrah came in and provided the visitors with some relief, Warner fell for 17. Steve Smith and Finch looked in cruise control, until the former was sent back by Jadeja. It was followed by a dramatic collapse. 4 wickets went down in quick succession. The late order had too much to do and ended up throwing their wickets in the process.",India won by 37 runs,T20,Australia vs India,3
"New Zealaned looked like they were coasting towards victory at one stage, but a middle-order meltdown cost them dear. They lost Guptill early, after a horrible misunderstanding with his skipper. It didn't matter a lot, Williamson struggled but fought his guts out, Munro took the attack to the bowling and an easy win was on the cards. Pakistan kept pegging away, Munro was cleaned up for 56, the inexperienced middle-order faltered and Williamson was left to do too much towards the end.",Pakistan won by 16 runs,T20,New Zealand vs Pakistan,3
"New Zealand go 1-0 up in the 3-match series. No one would have thought about this result when the hosts slumped to 99/6 after being asked to bat first. Nicholls and Santner lead the recovery. Henry and McClenaghan made merry towards the end, although the latter was felled by a hostile bouncer. That forced him out of the game and Williamson was left a bowler short. Elliott filled up for the breach, his bowling was disciplined and he was helped along by some reckless batting from Pakistan's openers. Hafeez and Babar Azam led the recovery, but both fell to indiscreet shots. The pressure of the rising rate took its toll on the rest and the tail collapsed badly, despite a brief fight from Sarfraz.",New Zealand won by 70 runs,ODI,New Zealand vs Pakistan,3
"New Zealand take the 3-match series 2-0. Pakistan gave a good account of themselves, but will be probably look back at their own batting collapse which cost them plenty of runs. 291 wasn't going to be an easy chase. It got worse after skipper Brendon McCullum went for a first ball duck. Martin Guptill and Kane Williamson took charge, added a record second wicket stand before both fell in their eighties. Pakistan kept fighting and reduced the hosts to 210/5 when rain finally forced a break in play. Upon resumption, they should have had Ronchi, but he was reprieved by Hafeez and then Corey Anderson got a big share of luck - after umpire Billy Bowden failed to detect a faint edge. Both were dismissed, but New Zealand completed the chase - with 3 wickets and 2 balls to spare.",New Zealand won by 3 wkts (D/L method),ODI,New Zealand vs Pakistan,4
"An easy win for Mortaza's men in the end. 163 was a good total on this track but the Bangladesh batsmen showed patience after losing a few wickets in the middle to seal this one. The experience of Shakib once again did the trick for them, he kept his calm and was amply supported by Nurul from the other end. Earlier, it was the pocket-sized dynamite Mushfiqur Rahim and Sabbir Rahman who got a good partnership in the middle overs to keep Bangladesh in the chase. Zimbabwe will rue their luck, their middle order failed else they could have posted at least 20 more on the board. When they came onto bowl, the hosts never allowed them to settle in and runs kept leaking. This is also the highest run chase by Bangladesh in T20Is.",Bangladesh won by 4 wkts,T20,Bangladesh vs Zimbabwe,3
"After UAE posted a challenging 172 on the board, Oman found it hard to get going. Their innings was dented by a flurry of wickets in the first 7 overs. Opener Zeeshan Maqsood showed some fight and resolve but the rest of the batters couldn't lay bat on ball. In the end, it was a walk in the park task for UAE who cruised through",United Arab Emirates won by 71 runs,T20,Oman vs United Arab Emirates,2
"This was a fierce battle where Pakistan almost turned up - with the ball and in installments. Powered by Bangladesh's top-shelf bowling effort and helped by Pakistan's aversion to singles, a target of 130 resulted and Bangladesh hunted it down but not sans drama. An Amir yorker stunned Soumya Sarkar just when his impending fifty looked set to sail Bangladesh through and then Shakib lost his stumps to spell danger. The Amir-effected wickets sandwiched Mushfiqur Rahim's debatable LBW and hopes then ballooned. Bangaldesh's pursuit for a stable start was cut short earlier, much like Tamim's peekaboo innings which featured a gigantic six before he perished to Irfan in a 4-ball stint. Sabbir Rahman's red-hot form yielded to some Afridi magic but there just weren't enough runs in the bank. Mahmudullah and Mortaza rode on Sami's hospitable no ball-laden over to set up a blockbuster finale against India.",Bangladesh won by 5 wkts,T20,Bangladesh vs Pakistan,2
"A target of 159 isn't so-so and more so on a slow, low Nagpur pitch. Zimbabwe were frugal with runs early on, bowling tight lines until Campbell yielded. His debut at 44 years of age lasted 19 balls for a meager 9 runs. Atkinson went on to score a fifty, the first ever for Hong Kong in a WT20, but Hayat and Chapman failed to hold fort at the other end. The opener couldn't carry on and perished trying to up the ante when the run rate spilled into danger zones. Captain Afzal was dropped on 17 but there was too much left to be done. Flurry of late wickets denied him the strike and both Tiripano and Chatara ended up with two wickets apiece in the win.",Zimbabwe won by 14 runs,T20,Hong Kong vs Zimbabwe,2
"So we have the first lopsided result of the tournament. Hong Kong started well with both bat and ball but didn't take long to lose their way either time. 117 would have taken some defending. And they weren't good enough. The bowlers were disciplined to begin with and managed to curb Shahzad's natural instincts early on. That was before Nadeem's left-arm spin unleashed all evil and opened the floodgates. Shahzad was eventually stalled at 41 mistiming a slog to long-off, and then a spurt of wickets towards the end induced a stutter but Najibullah broke the trance, took the match by the scruff and romped home.",Afghanistan won by 6 wkts,T20,Afghanistan vs Hong Kong,2
"The umpires had a chat about the rain, as it got heavier they have called for the covers. The players are making their way out to the pavillion and some good news for the Proteas, they are 4 runs ahead of the par score. We will start losing overs after an hour's delay. South Africa have won the match by 4 runs according to D/L method. For a change, D/L works in South Africa's favour! But spare a thought for Sri Lanka. They were a much better team today, and would have fancied their chances of winning the game.",South Africa win by 4 runs (D/L method),ODI,SL SA,1
"A clinical performance by Pakistan enabled them to romp home quite easily by 7 wickets in the end. Opting to bowl first, their bowlers gave them a perfect start by taking early wickets with Junaid and Ajmal being the pick of the bowlers. Chasing a paltry total of 97, the openers were off to a steady start and Hafeez in particular played aggressively and reached to his fifty also",Pakistan won by 7 wickets (D/L Method),ODI,PAK IRE,1
Total dominance by Sri Lanka as Canada were never in the game even for a moment. The bowlers backed up the good performance of the batsmen with a clinical display and Canada lost whatever little hope of a fight they had after Davison was sent back first ball by Perera. Sri Lanka will be very confident going into the next game and Canada have not displayed any reason for the ICC to change their stance on minnows in the next WC.,Sri Lanka won by 210 runs,ODI,CA SL,1
"South Africa will reflect upon the chances that they failed to convert. Parnell dismissed Perera off a no-ball, a host of gilt-edged run out chances were missed and Morne Morkel compounded the misery by dropping a skier off Mathews. They looked listless in the field in the final hour and one saw the worst of their fielding. They will want to finish the home summer on a high and the Highvelds await another cracker of a contest between these two teams on Sunday. Sighs of relief in the Sri Lankan camp, the support staff stand and applaud a well played innings from Perera. Dilshan and Sangakkara share a warm hug. This win must boost the morale of the Lankans as well as that of the underfire Dilshan and Geoff Marsh. They have had a torrid time in the ODIs and have a win to show for their efforts. This is the highest ever chase at the De Beer Diamond Oval, Kimberley.",Sri Lanka won by 5 wkts,ODI,SL SA,2
The pitch offered turn right from the first ball and Bangaldesh had done very well to restrict Pakistan to a low score after a quick start by their openers. The batsmen needed to make it count but put in a listless display. Not even one batsman offered a fight and wickets tumbled at regular intervals as Bangladesh struggled for momentum. Pakistan extend their winning run and Bangladesh's woes continue.,Pakistan won by 50 runs,T20,PK BAN,2
"Bangladesh just cannot defeat Pakistan. After bundling Pakistan out for 177, Bangladesh might have fancied their chances of victory. Although they lost Tamim to the first ball, Mahmudullah and Nafees shared a 69 run stand for the second wicket. It seemed that Bangladesh would coast along to the target.Then, a power failure followed. After a break of 15 minutes, Pakistan came out and Bangladesh crumbled under the pressure generated by the spinners. From 69/2, they stumbled to 83/6, with Hafeez and Rehman bowling like a dream. Kapali and Reza strung a partnership but a poor call from umpire Cloete ended the partnership and the Bangladesh tail failed to wag.",Pakistan won by 58 runs,ODI,PK BAN,2
"West Indies have defeated Bangladesh comprehensively, thus avenging their T20 defeat. Bangladesh made a wrong move right at the start of the innings, sending Islam to open with Tamim. The former played out too many dot balls and the pressure, eventually got to the Bangladesh batsman. Shakib tried hard to resurrect the innings with a quick fifty, but did not get support from the other end. For the West Indies, Rampaul and Samuels bowled their hearts out picking up 2 wickets in the process. Samuels especially, got through a lot of quick and tight overs strangulating the Bangladeshi batsmen. In the end the asking rate was too much for the tail and they fell short of the target.",West Indies won by 40 runs,ODI,BAN WI,2
"A target of 221 could have been a tricky one, given the nagging length that the Bangladeshi spinners bowl. But Simmons and Hyatt defended well and kept the scoreboard ticking at a steady pace. Once they bowlers started wearing out, they jumped on the accelerator. Hyatt got out for a well made 39. The man to replace him, Samuels just gave an example of his hunger for runs. He negotiated the good deliveries and mauled the bad ones. Simmons plodded away to another half century, his 8th score of 50+ in as many innings. With this performance West Indies have sealed the series",West Indies won by 8 wkts,ODI,BAN WI,2
"Bangladesh could not have timed this better. It has started to drizzle in Chittagong and they will be relieved. This is their second biggest win in terms of balls to spare in ODIs. On a sluggish Chittagong track, Bangladesh have huffed and puffed their way to the target. Tamim played slowly but the target was too little to defend for the West Indies bowlers. They will be disappointed with their poor show with the bat in this match but they will be happy that they won the series 2-1. Stay tuned for the presentation",Bangladesh won by 8 wkts,ODI,BAN WI,2
"A thumping victory for Swann in his first match as captain. The openers backed up the good performance of the bowlers to thrash West Indies. Sammy will have to motivate his boys to come out of this defeat quickly. Bopara, the Man of the Match, showed that he could be very useful with the ball in helpful conditions. The dew played a factor too with the WI spinners struggling to grip the ball in the latter part of the game.",England won by 10 wkts,T20,WI ENG,2
"Zimbabwe started well and put on a solid opening stand, but it was a slow stand which ultimately put the pressure on the ones down the order. Once the opening wicket fell, Pakistan kept the pressure on and a flurry of wickets in the middle dented Zimbabwe's chase. In the end it was too far a bridge for Zimbabwe to cross as the impressive young Pakistani side notched up a clean-sweep.",Pakistan won by 28 runs,ODI,PAK ZIM,2
"Never has the difference in fielding quality been more apparent. Zimbabwe were all over the field and dropped quite a few catches. Pakistan, on the other hand, caught everything that came their way and managed to convert a couple of half-chances too. Hafeez continued to have a wonderful tour and put in yet another all-round performance to hurt Zimbabwe",Pakistan won by 85 runs,T20,PAK ZIM,2
"Easy win in the end for Australia. The bowlers set the match up beautifully yet again with Bollinger leading the way, the batsmen did not need to do anything fancy, Watson was a bit cautious for his 43. Ponting and Clarke continued their form with a half-century each. The Lankan strategy of piling up spinners is not working at the moment.",Australia won by 8 wkts,ODI,AUS SL,2
Malinga provided the early wicket when he got rid of the danger man Watson. Australia never really got going after that. Wickets at regular intervals hurt their progress. Debutant Eranga impressed with his variety and got two important wickets. Hussey waged a lone battle but he fell in search of quick runs and with him fell all the Aussie hopes. SL have made it 2-1 now and showed that they were not going to be rolled over.,Sri Lanka won by 78 runs,ODI,AUS SL,2
"It has been a clinical performance from Australia despite the late stutter. Malinga started well picking two quick wickets but Marsh was in terrific nick. He got his chance and has made it count with a well made fifty. Debutant, Prasanna, picked three quick wickets but it was too late. Clarke was there till the end to take Australia home. It is Sri Lanka's biggest loss in terms of deliveries left at home. Australia clinch the 5 match series with this win.",Australia won by 5 wkts,ODI,AUS SL,2
"Zimbabwe have cantered home by seven wickets here. Shafiul and Rubel maintained the pressure at the start when they snapped Taylor cheaply. However, Sibanda and Masakadza steadied the ship before Masakadza departed. Taibu stepped up and guided Zimbabwe home with a gritty half century",Zimbabwe won by 7 wkts,ODI,ZM BAN,2
Pretty poor batting effort it must be said from the visitors as they handed the hosts the victory. Badri and Yusuf looked out of place and their places will come under scrutiny after their failures. The West Indies didn't do anything spectacular and just did the basics right. Any victory should please the fan of the home side for it has been a rare sight seeing their side win these days,West Indies won by 103 runs,ODI,WI IND,2
"It has been a comprehensive performance by England. Sri Lanka meekly surrendered after the loss of their top 4 batsmen. Only a fun filled partnership for the 9th wicket between Randiv and Malinga saved some blushes. There was no farewell innings from Jayasuriya as he ended a glittering career on a rather sombre note. Dilshan, Sangakkara and Mahela failed ro get past single figures. England bowlers, particularly Anderson proved to be rather handful under helpful conditions and were backed up by some excellent ground fielding and catching.",England won by 110 runs (D/L method),ODI,SL ENG,2
"A fine victory for Sri Lanka. It turned a bit farcical in the end with Mathews not scoring in an attempt to help Chandimal to his century, but all's well that ends well. A fine knock by the promising young talent, his 2nd in his career. Mahela Jayawardene chipped in with a sublime 79 as well.",Sri Lanka won by 6 wkts,ODI,SL ENG,2
"Half centuries from Hafeez, Misbah and Shafiq ensured an emphatic victory for Pakistan. The bowling was poor from the Windies with the exception of the young leggie Bishoo. The Windies would need to pull up their socks ahead of the next match on Monday",Pakistan won by 8 wkts,ODI,PAK WI,2
"Ahmad Shehzad overcame initial jitters and went on to compose a fine century, his second in ODIs, to complete a clinical victory. West Indies never seemed to be in the game despite keeping it tight through some steady bowling backed up by very good fielding but there was not enough fire in the attack to penetrate the strong Pakistan batting. Bishoo was the pick of the bowlers once again but lacked support from the other end.",Pakistan won by 7 wkts,ODI ,PAK WI,2
West Indies bowlers gave a good account of themselves but were left with very little to defend. Misbah showed why he is considered as the cool head of this Pakistan team with an innings of great concentration. Rampaul and young leggie Bishoo were very impressive taking the seven wickets between them,Pakistan won by 3 wkts,ODI ,PAK WI,2
"India have started their campaign with a comfortable win. Bangladesh lost their way after a furious start but it was always going to be a tall ask to maintain the tempo throughout the run chase. The ever improving Munaf provided the breakthrough initially when he sent back Kayes and Bangladesh were never really in the game after that despite fifties from Tamim and Shakib. The dew that was expected to play a part and influenced Shakib, to choose to bat first never really came in and Harbhajan aided by the back up spinners, kept the run rate under control quite easily. India will be looking to take this momentum into their next game while Bangladesh will have to pull up their socks very soon to bring some cheer to their passionate fans.",India won by 87 runs,ODI,BAN IND,2
"A clinical performance in the end by the Kiwis and they have knocked off the total in 8 overs to start their World Cup campaign in style. Their seamers did the damage by skittling out the Kenyans for a paltry 69, with Bennett taking 4 wickets and Southee and Oram sharing 3 each. Guptill and McCullum ensured they went past the target without any fuss.",New Zealand won by 10 wkts,ODI,NZ KEN,2
"Zimbabwe started off well with Coventry playing a few sweet shots, but once he was sucked in by Lee then the innings fell apart. Johnson picked up a few quick wickets and from then on it was always going to be an uphill task and it proved to be in the end. Cremer played well along with Utseya, but it was only delaying the inevitable.",Australia won by 91 runs,ODI ,AUS ZIM,2
It's been a comprehensive win to say the least. Shahid Afridi produced a blinder of a spell to rattle the Kenyan middle order and grabbed the best figures for a captain in WC games. There were no hiccups whatsoever for Pakistan as their bowlers ran through the Kenyan batting as if they had a train to catch. Collins Obuya was the only flash in the pan as he held one end up.,Pakistan won by 205 runs,ODI,KEN PAK,2
"The South Africans have started their WC campaign with a bang! West Indies have themselves to blame after their batting collapse. Darren Bravo had given them a solid platform but the Windies failed to capitalise. They came out to bowl, started well by taking two quick wickets but AB de Villiers played a scintillating knock, his 10th ODI century, to take the Proteas home comfortably with 7.1 overs to spare. Duminy and Graeme Smith also made fine contributions with the bat.",South Africa won by 7 wkts,ODI,SA WI,2
"Australia cruised home after a terrific opening partnership between Watson and Haddin yielded 133 runs. Both were in an aggressive mood looking to make the most of any small discretions in line and length by the bowlers. NZ bowlers were defending a very modest total and it was vital that they maintained pressure by taking early wickets. However, they were no match to the marauding pair who literally took each and every bowler apart. Even the normally accurate, Daniel Vettori, was not spared. The match was all but over by the time the openers were dismissed. Ponting, Clarke and White utilised the opportunity to hone their batting skills ahead of tougher challenges.",Australia won by 7 wkts,ODI,AUS NZ,2
"Sri Lanka have registered a comprehensive win after the splendid bowling performance by Malinga. Dilshan started off in a frenzy as they got off to the perfect start. Tharanga helped himself to a fifty as SL got home in a canter. Kenya will have a lot to think about in the upcoming games, while Sri Lanka have given their fans a lot to cheer about after the disappointing loss to Pakistan.",Sri Lanka won by 9 wkts,ODI,KEN SL,2
"Comprehensive is the only word that comes to mind when one describes NZ's batting performance. Guptill and Brendon McCullum never looked like getting out and the Zimbabwe bowlers struggled. Price, Utseya and Cremer kept it tight but they did not get the wickets",New Zealand won by 10 wkts,ODI,NZ ZIM,2
"One thought that this would be a match among equals but it was anything but that. West Indies have registered a comprehensive win with 226 balls to spare. Bangladesh have let themselves down completely and it will be a test of their character to come back from this demoralising defeat. For WI, the heartening aspect would be the performance of their captain Sammy who led from the front with the ball.",West Indies won by 9 wkts,ODI ,WI BAN,2
The Kenyans have showed some real character by lasting the full fifty overs. The Aussies will be a little disappointed that they could not bowl them out but a good workout nevertheless for their bowlers. They seemed to be looking at it as a practice game and have done their reputation no damage. Their unbeaten streak at WCs continues and it has now extended to 33 games. Collins Obuya will probably look back at this innings quite fondly despite missing the ton and the Kenyans do have some positives to take out from this game,Australia won by 60 runs,ODI,KEN AUS,2
"Pakistan were never in danger of losing the game and now stroll through to the quarter-finals. Asad Shafiq showed that he is a player for the future with a calm and composed knock. The Zimbabweans tried hard, but their lack of penetration in their bowling meant that they could never have envisioned hopes of a win. Pakistan were always in control and paced their chase quite beautifully to canter home.",Pakistan won by 7 wkts,ODI,PAK ZIM,2
Ireland were expected to put up a fight against SA and they did meet the expectations for some time with the ball. Duminy came in and arrested the slide and took South Africa to safety. Ireland never really recovered after the early strikes by Morkel. To their credit the South Africans never gave them any breathing space and kept it very tight throughout. They will be pleased with their bowling effort though there still seems to be slight concerns over the performance of the top order.,South Africa won by 131 runs,ODI,SA IRE,2
"A comprehensive win for Zimbabwe in the end as they end their WC campaign on a high. Winning the toss, they set a mammoth total first up and then they were backed up perfectly by Mpofu and then the spinners as they took wickets in regular intervals to trigger the collapse. In the end a poor WC for the Kenyans as they failed to secure a win all through the tournament.",Zimbabwe won by 161 runs,ODI,KEN ZIM,2
"Australia were always facing a herculean task after getting only 176. Still they came out with intent and forced the Pakistanis to earn each and every run. Lee was magnificent and if Tait and Johnson had combined together, the result could well have been very different. Still full marks to Shafiq, Younis Khan and Umar Akmal for gutsing it out and taking their side home. Umar Akmal took calculated risks and curbed his natural attacking instincts to play perhaps the most sensible innings of his life",Pakistan won by 4 wkts,ODI,PAK AUS,2
"Shambolic is what one can describe Bangladesh's exit from the 2011 World Cup. One struggled to figure out the mindset of the Bangladeshi batsmen when they walked out to bat. All played loose strokes and Tsotsobe ran through the top order with three wickets. Peterson came later on and he continued to tear into the Bangladeshi middle and lower order. Shakib was the highest scorer with 30, but none of the other batsmen could manage anything significant as Bangladesh folded up for 78, the second time that they have been bowled out for under a 100 in this World Cup.",South Africa won by 206 runs,ODI,BAN SA,2
"Ireland have truly shown that they are the best associate nation in this World Cup. They have ended the tournament on a high as they chased down a target of 300 plus in this tournament for the second time with six wickets to spare. The platform was set by Stirling and Porterfield who shared a record 177 run opening stand. Porterfield got an early reprieve when Raja dropped him on 1. Stirling scored boundaries at will as he blazed away to his century. However, the Netherlands came right back with the quick dismissals of Porterfield and Stirling. Niall O Brien came in and held the innings together, building crucial partnerships with Joyce and Wilson. It was a disappointing effort in the field from the Dutch and they go home without a single win.",Ireland won by 6 wkts,ODI,IRE NED,2
"The Aussie openers were ruthless, devastating and absolutely flawless as it rained runs at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. They started off slowly, but once they got their eye in, they took on the Canadian spinners and dispatched the ball to every possible corner. There were a couple of half chances that didn't go Canada's way and the duo made the most their hitting abilities. There was a race on who would get to his hundred first, but Haddin fell 12 runs short and he was dismissed at the fag end of the innings. Watson wanted to get to his hundred with a six and threw away his wicket. Ponting's misery continued as he failed to middle the ball yet again.",Australia won by 7 wkts,ODI,AUS CA,2
"A strange little match which never rose above the levels of mediocrity finally ends. Sri Lanka huffed and puffed their way to 236, not showing any intent even during the slog overs. Chandimal was the star with a fine 92. The chase was methodical as each and every batsman made handy contributions. JPD and Amla made fifties to anchor a good chase. The visitors have all the work to do ahead of the next 3 matches with the hosts sitting pretty at 2-0",South Africa won by 5 wkts,ODI,SL SA,3
"A convincing win in the end for Pakistan, but it was not without nerves. It took that man, Afridi, to come out and get his team past the winning mark. Misbah was ice cool until the end. Mohsin Khan will be worried with the way the chase went about. They will be happy with the win though. They go 1-0 up with two games to go. Another poor effort from the Bangladeshi batsmen. The lack of application has been their undoing all these years and it continues to haunt them. The bowlers did well to make a match in the end, but you cannot expect them to win matches from near impossible situations.",Pakistan won by 5 wkts,ODI,PK BAN,3
"The match was decided after just 10 overs of the chase when Bangladesh were reduced to 19/4. Shakib Al Hasan played a patient innings of 34, but it was the 20 year old Nasir who will take all the plaudits for scoring his first ODI ton. He became just the 2nd Bangladesh player to score a 100 against Pakistan, the 1st one being Shakib Al Hasan. Pakistan seemed to take it easy towards the end but all credit to the youngster for his fab effort. This is their 21st straight win against the hosts and they take the series 2-0.",Pakistan won by 76 runs,ODI,PK BAN,3
"A clinical performance from Pakistan today and their domination against the Lankans continues. After electing to bat, the Lankans got off to a poor start as the Pakistani seamers bowled a tight line and didn't give anything away. But the introduction of spinners triggered the collapse and they never came back after they lost wickets at regular intervals. Only Chandimal played steadily, but got out at a crucial time and the rest of the tail couldn't manage to get going. It was an easy chase for Pakistan and they did it in style with Farhat and Younis notching up their fifties and seeing them through",Pakistan won by 8 wkts,ODI,PK SL,3
"It was the Malinga and Perera show. They started brilliantly and removed the top order in the space of 4 overs. Umar Akmal then held the innings together with the help of crucial partnerships with Misbah and Sarfraz Ahmed. But the Lankans bounced back to take the wickets of Akmal and Ahmed in successive balls and not even a late order blitz from Afridi could take them to victory. Malinga and Perera were the stars of the show picking up 5 wickets for 76 runs in 18 overs between them. The spinners were ineffective, but the Pakistani middle order could not score as quickly as they would have liked against them. Umar Akmal would be heartbroken, as it was an innings of true class and maturity after a tentative start.",Sri Lanka won by 25 runs,ODI,PK SL,3
"124 was never going to be a problem for New Zealand. Certainly not with an opener named Brendon McCullum. He was lucky to survive an LBW appeal early on but never looked back since then. 6 sixes and 5 fours flew from his bat as he absolutely mauled Zimbabwe's bowlers. Guptill gave him good company and hit a few huge shots himself. Zimbabwe would want to forget this game soon, they were completely outplayed in all departments",New Zealand won by 10 wkts,T20,ZM NZ,3
"A terrific performance from New Zealand has helped them clinch the 2-match series 2-0 in the end. Batting first they amassed a huge total, courtesy twin fifties from Brendon and Guptill. It was always going to be a tough chase for Zim, but they showed some heart with Chigu and Chibhabha taking on the attack with some big blows. But the wicket of Chibhabha in the 14th over sparked the collapse and they ended up losing 4 wickets in 4 balls to hand the Kiwis a comfortable win in the end",New Zealand won by 34 runs (D/L method),T20,ZM NZ,3
"A Clinical performance from the Kiwis has helped them extend their domination over Zim. Their bowlers got them off to a great start by reducing Zim to 21/4, but Taylor and Futizwa played sensibly to bail them out of trouble and post a decent total. Chasing a modest total of 232, NZ got off to an aggressive start, with Nicol promoted ahead of Brendon to open the innings hitting his ton on debut and in the process becoming only the 7th batsmen in ODIs to do so. Guptill also played his part and in the end New Zealand cruised to victory.",New Zealand won by 9 wkts,ODI,ZM NZ,3
New Zealand have won the series with ease. Brendan Taylor must be wondering what more he should do to inspire his men. He got another fantastic ton under pressure today and Zimbabwe posted a good score in the must win game. The bowlers were a huge let down once more. Martin Guptill is cashing in on his good form and got his second ODI ton as the Kiwis cruised in the chase. The untested middle order faltered towards the end but McCullum and Guptill had done enough by then to ensure the win,New Zealand won by 4 wkts,ODI,ZM NZ,3
"India have outplayed England in all departments. This might be the headline in most of the news forums tomorrow morning. Given the performance in England, few would have imagined that, but India have shown why they are a Champion side, at least when it comes to ODIs. After a iffy start, Kohli and Raina consolidated well with Dhoni and Jadeja giving the fireworks to set up a good total. The English batsmen were ticking the scoreboard well initially, but once Cook got out, the other batsmen followed him to the hut almost like ducklings follow the mother duck. They lost the last 8 wickets for 63 runs. The spin duo of Ashwin and Jadeja were the wreckers-in-chief as they bamboozled the batsmen with turn and flight. The other bowlers looked good in patches and with this win, fans will expect a lot as far as the other matches are concerned.",India won by 126 runs,ODI,IND ENG,3
"It was not that stiff a target for an Indian batting lineup brought up on such tracks. The performance of the England bowlers in the initial overs was really commendable. They conceded only 25 runs in the first ten overs. For Rahane, this match was a horror and he toiled away to 20 off 37 balls. Considering that this was his home ground, better things were expected from him. But once he got out, Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina ensured that there were no more hiccups. They picked the singles and doubles regularly and once the target looked to be in reach, launched an attack which stunned the Englishmen. Kohli has to be praised for his maturity, he played the sheet anchor role to perfection. In the end, Dhoni came into the middle and polished off a few boundaries to seal the win. As mentioned earlier, Finn was the pick of the bowlers, but he had practically no support from the others.",India won by 6 wkts,ODI,IND ENG,3
"Kevin Pietersen's superb fifty ensured that England chased down a modest 121 with 8 balls to spare. The wicket was tough to bat on, India struggled, kept losing wickets and found themselves in deep trouble. England on the other hand, targetted the initial overs and ensured that they didn't fall below the required rate at any point in time. Ravindra Jadeja was the pick of the bowlers for India as he managed to give away just 9 runs in his quota of 4 overs. That wasn't good enough as the Indian bowlers didn't pick up wickets when needed",England won by 6 wkts,ODI,IND ENG,3
A tremendous game to start off the series. Warner departed for a first ball duck but South Africa will be ruing the dropped chance of Watson by Graeme Smith. He went on to score a blazing fifty to put Australia on the right path in this chase. They lost few wickets towards the end but they did not panic and they go 1-0 up in the two match series by winning this match by five wickets,Australia won by 5 wkts,T20,SA AUS,3
"South Africa never looked in the chase right from the start. They lost wickets at regular intervals. Funny thing that most of their batsmen were timing the ball really well, but kudos to the Australian bowlers who used helpful conditions to good effect. Doherty bowled a stump to stump line and kept the batsmen quiet, whereas Marsh and Cummins impressed on debut. Both of them picked up a wicket in their very first overs. Johnson got the ball to swing into the right handers and 3 wickets against his name will be a good boost for him",Australia won by 93 runs (D/L method),T20,SA AUS,3
"A thumping win this for the home side. The batsmen set it up by scoring 300+ and the bowlers followed it up with a disciplined show. They never allowed Australia to go on top, and kept chipping away at the wickets at regular intervals. There was not much fight from Australia after the Warner-Hussey partnership, and it was all one way traffic from there",South Africa won by 80 runs,ODI,SA AUS,3
So near yet so far for Zimbabwe. Sibanda gave them a perfect start and put on a good stand with the skipper before throwing it away. Taylor continued in the company of Taibu but lost their way towards the end. Chigumbura and Taylor played some strokes towards the end but none of them managed to take them over the line.,Pakistan won by 5 runs,ODI,PAK ZIM,3
"Clinical performance from Pakistan as they outplayed Zimbabwe in all the departments today. 225 was never going to be a tough target on this pitch, but the Pakistani openers played superbly to notch up the highest opening stand for Pakistan in ODIs. Hafeez was very fluent in his innings and got to his 3rd ODI century in style with a huge slog sweep over midwicket. So Pakistan are 2-0 up in the series and will be hugely satisfied with their effort.",Pakistan won by 10 wkts,ODI,PAK ZIM,3
A fine match for Eoin Morgan as captain. He is also the Man of the Match for his fine 59. Dernbach bowled very well in the end overs and picked up crucial wickets to restrict Ireland. Trott set it up with a composed knock and Ireland fought well but did not have enough firepower to cross the line.,England won by 11 runs,ODI,ENG IRE,3
"A comprehensive win for Sri Lanka, they started slowly with the bat, but Dilshan's onslaught took them to 198, which was a really good total on this wicket. The Aussies were under pressure, lost wickets regularly and couldn't capitalize. Perera starred with the ball, as he picked 3 wickets on debut and rattled the middle order. Great team effort in the end, hand shakes all around as the Sri Lankans make their way out.",Sri Lanka won by 35 runs,T20,AUS SL,3
An easy chase in the end for Australia. Shane Watson continued his superb recent form with a blistering knock of 69. Ponting and Clarke spent useful time out in the middle with half-centuries as Australia cruised home to take a 1-0 lead. SL bowling was a bit ragged but they hardly had a chance,Australia won by 7 wkts,ODI,AUS SL,3
Sri Lanka have managed a consolation win. It was set up by Malinga's hat-trick. Mahela played a very handy knock. It was a scratchy innings but he managed to hang in there for a long time. Chamara Silva gave the innings some impetus with a very good knock.,Sri Lanka won by 4 wkts,ODI,AUS SL,3
"All-round display from Zimbabwe helped them register a facile win over Bangladesh. Vitori was the pick of the bowlers as he became the first Zimbabwean to take a five-for in his debut match. Only Shakib and Rahim offered some resistance with the bat, with rest of the batsmen falling to loose shots. Zim started off aggressively, with Sibanda leading the pack with a superb 96. They lost a flurry of wickets in the middle, but Mutizwa stayed till the end to take them home.",Zimbabwe won by 4 wkts,ODI,ZM BAN,3
"England got off to a bad start as they lost Hales, but KP and Kieswetter managed to increase the scoring rate. Morgan was the star in the middle overs as he scored a brisk 49. Samit Patel and Bopara stayed till the end and took England over the line as they won the one-off T20I by six wickets",England won by 6 wkts,T20,ENG IND,3
"England can do no wrong here. After they got off to a superb start, the spinners, led by Jadeja and Ashwin, pulled things back by picking two wickets, with a third one being taken by Munaf. After a short rain delay, the target was reduced to 218 in 43 overs. Stokes and Bopara played steadily. Bopara guided the chase beautifully and he got good support from Bresnan. In the end, England managed to scrape through by three wickets.",England won by 3 wickets (D/L),ODI,ENG IND,3
"A comfortable victory for the Indians, their bowlers did a tremendous job by choking runs in the middle overs. Darren Bravo looked good but failed to get the big hits going and despite his knock of 41, they needed a run rate of over 14. Three quick wickets in the 16th and 17th over made things worse and the West Indies fell short by 16 runs.",India won by 16 runs,T20,WI IND,3
Another walk in the park for India and they are well on course for a series victory. The win was always on cards despite the early loss of Shikhar Dhawan. Kohli batted superbly for his 81 while Parthiv chipped in with 56. Rain meant India were set a revised target of 183 and they seemed to be in a hurry after the resumption. Raina ended the match with a brisk 26.,India won by 7 wickets (D/L method),ODI,WI IND,3
India looked good to get over 300 at one point but lost the plot completely soon after. WI were clinical in the chase. Sarwan was rock solid when he was out there. Darren Bravo chose the right time to attack and Samuels finished it off in style. India will be disappointed with their effort today. The dropped catches did not help their cause either. Kohli was looking good for a big innings and India desperately needed him to stay till the end. The fact that India did not last the entire fifty overs cost them dearly in the end. WI were clearly playing for pride in the last two games and they will be very pleased with their effort.,West Indies won by 7 wkts,ODI ,WI IND,3
"Sri Lanka looked the better team out on the park today. Pietersen and Morgan shone briefly with the bat, but it went downhill afterwards as the later order batsmen failed to come into grips with the bowling. SL started well and despite the loss of Jayasuriya, they seemed to be in cruise control. Sangakkara and Jayawardene looked outstanding and unhurried in a classic lesson of T-20 batting as they eased home with 16 deliveries left",Sri Lanka won by 9 wkts,T20,SL ENG,3
A fine all-round performance from Sri Lanka. Mahela Jayawardene showed class in scoring a career best 144. He was well supported by Sangakkara who made 69. Mathews chipped in with an unbeaten 46. Morgan was the only batsman to go past 50 for England as several batsmen got a start but failed to build on it. The spinners combined well for Sri Lanka and were backed up by some smart keeping and fielding.,Sri Lanka won by 69 runs,ODI,SL ENG,3
"It has been a rather one sided affair. England won what seemed to be a great toss to win, the match was all but over when SL slumped to 11/3. Sangakkara fought hard for his 75 as SL managed to post 174. It was not a big target by any stretch but none would have anticipated the Cook show. He was fed to his strengths and made the most of it. Kieswetter was the ideal foil for him as the duo completed the biggest 1st wicket partnership against Sri Lanka. Cook deserved a ton but he will be more or less chuffed with this knock. He has definitely shut the mouths of a few nay-sayers.",England won by 10 wickets (D/L method),ODI,SL ENG,3
It has been a comprehensive win for West Indies and they will take a lot of confidence going into the 2 match Test series. Pakistan were let down by their batting and the bowlers hardly had any chance of defending a meagre score. Lendl Simmons continued his good form with yet another half-century.,West Indies won by 10 wkts,ODI ,PAK WI,3
"Bangladesh finally showed some resolve to fight, but that was not good enough to stop a rampaging Australia. Kayes, Nafees and Mahmudullah all scored individual fifties with Kayes unfortunately falling short of his ton by 7 runs. Australia will be pleased by the performance of their batters though they would be a touch disappointed that they failed to bowl Bangladesh out even once. Bangladesh will feel satisfied by the batting efforts, coming after a pretty poor World Cup, though their reliable spinners took an absolute hammering at the hands of the Aussie batsmen particularly Watson",Australia won by 66 runs,ODI ,AUS BAN,3
"Bangladesh have really pulled out the rabbit out of the hat. They started off with the spinners and it paid rich dividends as they sent back the openers cheaply. None of the Irish batsmen got going and the Bangladeshi spinners continued to pile on the pressure. Kevin O Brien and Andre Botha strung together a good partnership, but Shafiul Islam broke the partnership and ran through the tail to complete a thrilling 27 run victory for the Tigers.",Bangladesh won by 27 runs,ODI ,BAN IRE,3
"Zimbabwe's spinners have really risen to the occasion. When Davison departed to a poor shot, Canada lost steam. Ray Price continued to wreck the top order and picked up 3/16 in eight overs. He was well backed up by Utseya and Cremer as they lost wickets at regular intervals. The tail did frustrate the Zimbabwean bowlers for some time but the result was never in doubt. In the end, Zimbabwe win by a massive 175 runs and register their first win in the World Cup after eight years. This is also their biggest win in terms of runs in ODIs",Zimbabwe won by 175 runs,ODI,ZIM CA,3
England realised once again how great a leveller the game could be as the tables were turned on them on the very ground they secured a moral victory chasing a similar total just a few days back. Ireland held their nerve to register a famous victory and the superlatives will continue to flow when we recall this match in the future,Ireland won by 3 wkts,ODI,IRE ENG,3
"It has been a comprehensive victory for the Proteas. The openers got off to a slow start and the pressure mounted. The best partnership of the innings was 40 between Zuiderent and Barresi. However, the South African spinners led by Tahir and Peterson ran through the lower middle order. Netherlands capitulated from 81/3 to being 120 all out. South Africa win by 231 runs and it is the fourth biggest run win in the history of the World Cup.",South Africa won by 231 runs,ODI,SA NED,3
"Canada have thrown away their best chance to stage an upset win over Pakistanis. Credit to Afridi, the way he has led his bunch of men has been remarkable. Yet again, he led from the front, took his 5th five wicket haul to rattle the Canadian batting. He is also the highest wicket taker in this tournament so far. Surkari and Hansra kept Canada in the hunt but once Afridi started sending out darters, they fell like nine pins.",Pakistan won by 46 runs,ODI,PAK CA,3
"This was just not Pakistan's day. Southee and Mills were devastating with the new ball as they ripped through the top order. None of the Pakistani batsmen managed to negotiate the swing and were sent back cheaply. Umar Akmal and Razzaq struggled to get going in the middle overs, with both struggling to rotate the strike. Razzaq and Gul delayed the inevitable with a record ninth wicket stand of 66 for Pakistan in World Cups, but it proved to be a bridge too far and Pakistan lost by 110 runs. In the end, this is a superb performance by the NZ back up bowlers who bowled admirably in the absence of Daniel Vettori, who hobbled off the field with an injured knee.",New Zealand won by 110 runs,ODI,PAK NZ,3
India have made heavy weather of a low target and it was left to their last two specialist batsmen to get them home. It looked initially that the Indians wanted to improve the net run rate and win quickly but soon lost the plot as wickets tumbled in quick succession. Admittedly the Indians were looking for a light game and the batsmen seemed to have little respect for the the Dutch bowlers and paid a heavy price for it as the bowlers stuck to the basics. Yuvraj Singh put his head down for the second time in a row and play sensibly to help India cross the line.,India won by 5 wkts,ODI ,NED IND,3
"Zimbabwe collapsed from a position of strength and it was that man yet again who started it all for Sri Lanka. Playing his last match at Kandy, Murali broke a stubborn opening stand that was causing some concern for Sri Lanka. Brendan Taylor was in terrific touch and looked good for more but fell at the wrong time and thereafter it was all Sri Lanka. Everything Dilshan touched turned to gold today and he was in excellent form with the ball as well picking up 4 wickets. He could have had a hat-trick too but Mahela could not latch on to a low catch after having taken a blinder off the previous delivery. Zimbabwe will be very disappointed after having had a good start and could have shown some more fight. Sri Lanka completed a victory that was expected all along and will be happy with it going into the forthcoming bigger matches",Sri Lanka won by 139 runs,ODI,SL ZIM,3
"One struggles to understand what the Canadians were doing out there. Right from the start, they hardly showed any intent in chasing the target down. Bagai and Hansra stroked gritty fifties but they hardly looked like increasing the scoring rate during their stay in the middle. However, both were laid low by cramps, with Hansra in particular suffering the most. There were significant delays as the physio attended to them. Due to this, the contest ended very late and NZ won by a comfortable 97 runs. This match will once again throw up the debate about the role of the associate members in the World Cup. From the Ireland fairy-tale against England to the Canadian Yawn against New Zealand, the associate members have had extreme results.",New Zealand won by 97 runs,ODI,NZ CAN,3
"It has been a confident show by the Bangladeshis. Tamim was cleaned up in the first over by Bukhari and one felt that the Men in Orange would put up a fight, but Imrul Kayes and Junaid Siddique anchored the innings and put Bangladesh on course. Kayes continued his impressive form as he scored back to back fifties. The Dutch, however, got their own back, when they made Bangladesh work hard for the last 10 runs. They bowled a couple of maiden overs and they picked up two wickets. However, the result was never in doubt and Bangladesh recorded a massive 6 wicket win.",Bangladesh won by 6 wkts,ODI,BAN NED,3
"As expected, the Sri Lankan spinners have rattled the Kiwis at the Wankhede. The wicket was offering appreciable turn, and the Kiwis, who are not great players of the turning ball, succumbed to the great man Murali. The Lankans were initially sloppy on the field dropping Ryder and Taylor early on in their innings, but the spinners came back and took wickets in frequent intervals to ensure that they move to the top of the table. Sangakkara, their captain, led from the front with a fantastic hundred that set the stage for the spinners to do some magic and Jayawardene chipped in with a very useful knock.",Sri Lanka won by 112 runs,ODI,SL NZ,3
"New Zealand will be mighty pleased with their effort but they were unlucky that they came up short. On a pitch that was slowing up considerably, Dilshan and Sangakkara played a superb innings. They carted the Kiwi bowlers to all parts of the ground and it seemed that the game was headed towards an early finish. They went past their fifties and shared a 120 run partnership to put SL on course. However, three wickets fell for just nine runs and NZ gave a good fight. Chamara Silva and Samaraweera struggled to score runs and NZ were slowly but surely applying pressure. Silva continued his poor run, but Samaraweera and Mathews held their nerve till the end. Mathews, aided by the runner, struck some crucial blows to give the Sri Lankans a thrilling five wicket win.",Sri Lanka won by 5 wkts,ODI,NZ SL,3
"This has been a good performance by the Indian bowlers. Rahul Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja kept a tight check on the runs at the start and during the middle overs. Rahul Sharma picked up three wickets in his first three overs. Russell hit some big hits but Ramdin stayed firm. The last wicket stand of 64 between Ramdin and Narine frustrated India but Ramdin was unlucky to miss out on his century. However, on this day, mark this in your calendar, Virender Sehwag achieved history.",India won by 153 runs,ODI,WI IND,4
"Comprehensive victory for the Pakistanis. When Dilshan and Sangakkara were going strong, it looked like Sri Lanka would win easily. But they ran like madmen and gifted wickets to Pakistan. The bowlers were impeccable in their line and length. Sri Lanka made some contentious decisions like sending in Malinga at 8 which did not work. The pick of the bowlers were Gul and Ajmal who picked up 3 wickets each with the latter keeping it tight in the middle overs. Pakistan go 2-1 up in the 5 match series and look set to win it. Sri Lanka need to think hard, for it was a match which they looked set to win, but lost their way.",Pakistan won by 21 runs,ODI,PK SL,4
"What an thrilling match we have witnessed just now, with Pak holding their nerve towards the end to emerge victorious. Chasing 142, they got off to an explosive start, but lost wickets in a heap, with their batsmen falling to loose shots. Misbah however stood firm at the other end and stitched an important stand with Asad and then with Afridi to take his side home. On the other hand, the Sri Lankans will be gutted as another 10-15 runs would have made a huge impact to this match, but they were poor in their batting, which has been a concern for them off late and they finish the tour on a disappointing note.",Pakistan won by 5 wkts,T20,PK SL,4
"This has been a fantastic victory for India. They looked to be in trouble when they lost the openers but it was the unbeaten 209 run partnership between the two local boys, Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir, that steered India home. Both were fantastic, with Virat reaching his 2nd century in three innings. He also went past 1000 runs in ODIs this year. Gambhir also provided great support as the England bowlers ran out of ideas.",India won by 8 wkts,ODI,IND ENG,4
A tremendous game to start off the series. Warner departed for a first ball duck but South Africa will be ruing the dropped chance of Watson by Graeme Smith. He went on to score a blazing fifty to put Australia on the right path in this chase. They lost few wickets towards the end but they did not panic and they go 1-0 up in the two match series by winning this match by five wickets,Australia won by 5 wkts,T20,SA AUS,4
"Parnell and Theron have put on a partnership of 64 runs in 27 deliveries. It was just one of those days for White and his boys. The pacers had bowled exceptionally well on a wicket which provided them some support. Cummins looked fiery and in his first spell of 2 overs, gave away just three runs and accounted for 2 wickets. Botha consolidated a bit in the middle, but when he fell, things looked bleak for South Africa. But as they say, when the going gets tough, the tough get going and Parnell & Theron proved just that. They are into the cricketing record books now, for this is the highest 8th wicket partnership in T20 Internationals.",South Africa won by 3 wkts,T20,SA AUS,4
"West Indies had the upper hand for the major part of the match. Their bowlers, especially Samuels, strangulated the Bangladesh batsmen during the middle overs. But it was the penultimate over by the debutant Brathwaite which sealed the victory for the hosts. He conceded 14 runs off the over and with 4 required off the last 2 balls, Rahim whacked one into the stands. He will be delighted with the victory, especially after a good performance by the bowlers and fielders. Rampaul, well, he has always bowled his heart out but somehow misses the target in the final stages of a match.",Bangladesh won by 3 wkts,T20,BAN WI,4
"From 71-0 in the 6th over to 149/9 in 20. Who would have imagined that when Shane Watson was toying around with the bowling? But credit to Sri Lanka, and Mendis in particular, for the stunning comeback. They came back from nowhere and choked Australia with spin to take the game, despite some late hitting from Cameron White",Sri Lanka won by 8 runs,T20,AUS SL,4
"Finally Pakistan managed to win the match by 5 wickets and the take the series 2-0. It was an improved performance by Ireland today as they posted a respectable total of 238, thanks mainly to Stirling's century. But it was Wilson who provided them the late onslaught towards the end. Chasing 239, Pakistan faltered a bit at the start, but Younis and Azhar Ali revived them by stitching an important partnership. But it was Umar Akmal's useful fifty that changed the fortunes for them. Ireland will be happy with their performance today as it came against a strong side.",Pakistan won by 5 wkts,ODI,PAK IRE,4
"The final ODI was the best of the lot, with SL faltering in the end. Mathews played an innings of high quality and almost took them close to the victory. He came in at a time when SL were struggling at 123/4. Jeevan Mendis also played his part as he along with Mathews stitched the all important partnership 102 runs for the 6th wicket. But England held their nerve in the end to clinch a thrilling win by 16 runs. Randiv took his maiden 5-wicket haul in this match, but that was not enough for SL to force a win as their top order succumbed to some excellent seam bowling by Bresnan. In the end it was Dernbach, who held his nerve in the 49th over by taking 2 wickets in 2 balls, including the crucial wicket of Mathews who was standing in the way of an English win.",England won by 16 runs,ODI ,SL ENG,4
Bangladesh would have entertained hopes of choking Australia after they got to 229 but it was not to be. Watson was in a murderous mood from the first over. Some incredible hitting saw him hit 15 sixes and break the world record for maximum sixes in an innings. He also went past Hayden to record the highest individual score by an Aussie. He ended on a mind-boggling 185 of just 96 balls. No bowler was shown any mercy and were taken to the cleaners.,Australia won by 9 wkts,ODI,AUS BAN,4
The pressure was piled on when Pakistan posted a very good score. Sri Lanka appeared to be a little confused as to attack first or preserve wickets and the fall of wickets at regular intervals did not help their cause either. Afridi led from the front and was inspirational on the field. He played a part in five of the first six wickets to fall. Akhtar struck crucial blows but the more heartening aspect for Pak would be that he was steaming in even at the death displaying his much improved fitness. Pakistan have held their nerve for a famous win to boost their confidence,Pakistan won by 11 runs,ODI,PAK SL,4
"A massive win for West Indies, they needed it badly to keep their spirits alive after the early loss in the tournament at the hands of the Proteas. Sammy started off with Roach and Benn, the pace and spin combination did not allow the batsmen to settle down, they kept losing wickets in quick intervals and after ten Doeschate failed to score, it was a tough ask from the middle and the lower order batsmen. Roach was sensational with the ball, picked up 6 important wickets and also took a hat-trick towards the end of the innings.",West Indies won by 215 runs,ODI,WI NED,4
"In the battle of the minnows, Canada have truly come out on top. Cheema got going immediately, but he was cleaned up by Otieno. A slight stutter occurred in the middle when Gunasekera and Surkari departed cheaply. However, the turning point of the match occurred when Hansra came to the crease. Off James Ngoche's first ball, he mistimed a shot to mid on and Waters spilled a sitter. He made Kenya pay dearly as he and Bagai went past their half centuries. Their 132 run partnership is the highest ever partnership for Canada in World Cups. This partnership helped Canada record their second World Cup victory by five wickets. Kenya will be very disappointed with their effort.",Canada won by 5 wkts,ODI,KEN CA,4
Ireland have faltered after getting a good start. Ed Joyce and Wilson had kept them in the hunt for a long time with well made fifties but West Indies were all over the Irish batsmen once these two fell. Wilson will consider himself very unlucky after being dismissed under controversial circumstances and the UDRS debate will rage on. Sammy led from the front with the ball and kept it very tight in the initial overs delivering three maiden overs on the trot. Ireland will take a lot of pride having been in the game for a long time while West Indies continue to improve with another strong win,West Indies won by 44 runs,ODI,IRE WI,4
South Africa have refused to choke this time and it helped that they were offered a lot of breathers from India. Both teams had their chances of closing the game out but the momentum kept shifting repeatedly and SA held their nerves. This win would give them a huge boost more so coming after that infamous choke against England at Chennai. India will have no one to blame except themselves. They had the match in the bag but lost their heads in the end overs and that has cost them dearly. Peterson is the toast of SA and deservedly so. He kept his head superbly till the end and ticked all the right boxes,South Africa won by 3 wkts,ODI,SA IND,4
"What a game we have had folks! England have bounced back after the Gayle storm that struck Chennai for the first ten overs, they took wickets in regular intervals and they have kept the quarter final hopes alive. The spinners set it up for them, Tredwell took 4, Swann took 3 and they rattled the dodgy middle order of West Indies. Outstanding game this, the joy on the faces of the English players tell a thousand stories. The wickets of Pollard and Sarwan were key, and once they went, it was a touch too much to ask from the West Indian tail.",England won by 18 runs,ODI,ENG WI,4
"Sri Lanka came right back into the series with two wins. One wonders that if rain had not interuppted the proceedings in the 3rd ODI, it might well have been 3-2 in the visitors favor. It has been a lion-hearted performance from them, chasing two targets of over 300 in consecutive matches.Phew! Let me catch my breath. What a game this has been. Sangakkara and Thirimanne were outstanding with the bat. Sanga notched up his maiden ODI century against SA while Thirimanne notched up his first ODI fifty. Wickets tumbled at the end as South Africa made a match of it. However, Senanayake struck a six that got SL crossed the line with two wickets to spare.",Sri Lanka won by 2 wkts,ODI,SL SA,5
"What a match this has been. India started the chase in an explosive manner and every one would have thought of an early finish, but WI bowlers came back strongly and especially Russell struck 2 important blows to leave India reeling at 59/5. But Jadeja and Rohit Sharma stitched an all important partnership for the 6 wicket to bail India out of trouble. But once Jaddu got out to a loose shot, WI found the opening they wanted. Rohit Sharma and the tail-enders found it hard to score on this slow wicket, but two quick wickets towards the end spiced up this boring match as WI sensed a win. But poor bowling changes cost Sammy the match as Umesh and Aaron held their nerve to finish it on a high.",India won by 1 wkt,ODI,WI IND,5
"Terrific match it was for Zimbabwe and they thoroughly deserved the win. They also recorded their highest ever successful run chase in ODIs in the process. Chasing 329, they were off to a shaky start with Sibanda getting out in the 2nd ball, but Taylor continued from where he had left and revived them a bit. But it was Waller who stayed till the end inspite of the wickets falling at the other end to take them home",Zimbabwe won by 1 wkt,ODI,ZM NZ,5
"This has been a cracker of a game for the Windies. Bishoo was the star as he snapped up four wickets. The Pakistani batting failed to get going. Umar Akmal and Saeed Ajmal gave some fight, but in the end, the West Indies bowlers bowled well and they managed to win by seven runs.",West Indies won by 7 runs,T20,PAK WI,5
"This has been a nerve-wracking encounter to say the least. The balance of the game shifted from one side to the other, at the halfway stage the Indians were sitting comfortably at the top, but sensational batting from Strauss took the game totally away from them. But there was a Zaheer Khan, who decided to change a thing or two, came back strongly in the batting powerplay, took crucial wickets to bring India back into the game. But Swann and Shahzad held their nerves and this was a fitting end to an evenly contested game. Absolute thriller! This has surely been the best game of this WC, and lets hope there are many such games coming our way though the heart takes a bit of a beating in such games.",Match tied,ODI ,IND ENG,5
"Ladies and Gentlemen, the word choke has a new meaning in all dictionaries. The new meaning reads South Africa. Only they could conspire to lose from a winning situation. It looked great at 124/3, but they lost 4 wickets for just just three runs. Wyk and Steyn strung together a gritty 33 run stand, but Bresnan sent Wyk back and it looked like the game would go down the wire. Broad produced a miracle as he snapped up the final two wickets. Credit for this victory must go to Graeme Swann who bowled an excellent spell. He had Smith all at sea against his ripping off-breaks. In the end, a combined team effort has seen England win an absolute thriller by six runs.",England won by 6 runs,ODI,ENG SA,5
"WHAT A GAME! Once again, England make the broadcasters smile. Somehow, they manage to make every game they play a nail-biting thriller! Needing a moderate 226 for a win, Bangladesh got off to a flier - with Tamim showing why he is called 'Boom Boom Tamim Iqbal' by his fans. The home team raced to 50 in the 8th over, a score which England had taken 15 overs to reach. Then, a sea-saw battle started. Bangladesh lost their way for a while, with Tamim, Siddique and Roqibul falling in quick succession. In came captain Shakib Al Hasan, with a world of pressure on his shoulders. He, along with Kayes steadied the ship putting on an 82 run partnership. Just when the English shoulders dropped, Bangladesh gifted them a wicket - the wicket of the well set Kayes to a needless run out. Ajmal Shahzad bowled a dream spell with unplayable deliveries and a flurry of wickets followed, with 3 wickets including Shakib's falling in a gap of 7 runs. Sensing a defeat looming large, a major part of the crowd started to leave. Well, they must be cursing themselves now. Don't ever leave the stadium when England is playing! Bangladesh found an unexpected hero with the bat in the form of Shafiul Islam. The tail ender, in company of Mahmadullah, smashed the bowlers across the park. Pressure shifted to England once again and they had no answers. Wides, half volleys and fumbles followed as the remaining crowd got behind their heroes. They didn't let them down either as the duo added a 50+ partnership. And then, all I remember is the four through the off side, and the Bangladesh celebration...",Bangladesh won by 2 wkts,ODI,BAN ENG,5
"A clinical chase from the world champions! Smith is greeted with handshakes as he walks back to the changing room guiding his team home. Chasing a tricky target of 264, Warner started off positively. But once again Amir and Junaid were superb with the new ball scalping both the openers. In walked the debutant Peter Handscomb to join his skipper at the crease. He didn't come alone - he brought fortune with him. He was caught on nought off Junaid - but the bowler had overstepped. And sooner, he was dropped on 10. After that, he played sensibly with his leader and threaded a 183-run stand for the third wicket. Smith was impeccable bringing up his eighth century and also went past the 3000-run mark in the process. Pakistanis went defensive and that helped the hosts to maneuver past the danger area during the chase. Travis Head provided the finishing touches and ensured that there weren't any hiccups.",Australia won by 7 wkts, ODI,Australia vs Pakistan,3
"This is a win shoplifted. Absolutely stolen. England had done everything right - put on 350 runs on the board, had the hosts reeling at 63/4 until they encountered Virat Kohli. 27th ODI ton for the man who never disappoints. But Kohli wasn't alone in this, for a change. After Yuvraj had been ""unlucky"" at No.4, leg-glancing one straight to the keeper; after Dhoni had failed to finish the innings, not for the first time of late, in walked Jadhav to smack a 65-ball hundred, an effort that bettered Kohli's. Another chase looked to be boiling over but both the set batsmen fell, 28 runs apart, after a mammoth 200-run stand off just 147 balls. India seeked a finisher, India found a finisher.. in Hardik Pandya's unbeaten 40 off 37 balls that sailed them home.",India won by 3 wkts, ODI,India vs England,5
"Roy and Billings provided the flier at the top, and Morgan and Root played with calm heads in the middle to prevent any panic from materializing after Chahal's double strike. The England skipper rotated the strike wonderfully and almost every half-tracker he faced, disappeared. He couldn't have found a steadier partner in Root. India were indisciplined with the new ball causing Kohli to turn to spin early. The move worked as Chahal bowled beautifully but the damage had been done. Arguably, 147 was at least 20 runs light of a par score here, if not more. That's where Moeen Ali's career-best 2/21 set the game up. India kept losing wickets all the way through which never allowed them to have a proper go. Full credit to England. They assessed conditions better than India, found the right lengths - shorter than a good length - and stuck to it.",England won by 7 wkts, T20,India vs England,2
"What a match! What a turnaround from Bumrah and Nehra at the end. The duo were sensational in their use of off-cutters combined with some brilliant yorkers. The off-cutters more so. They bowled them into the pitch which was mightily responsive to such variation. England were cruising when Stokes and Root were going. But it was always going to be about one wicket on this sluggish pitch. All that into consideration, England will feel they should have got home here. Especially after plundering 16 off the penultimate over to leave just 8 to get off the final one. But it was Bumrah's day to emerge as the hero. India are alive in the series.",India won by 5 runs, T20,India vs England,5
"308 was always going to be a difficult target on a pitch where the ball was stopping and holding. But it was made almost improbable with the way South Africa fielded. The hosts were on fire in the field. A couple of brilliant catches, a swift stumping, a run out through a direct hit. They were relentless. Sri Lanka had a promising start but it didn't take long for them to lose their way from 45/1 to 75/4. Chandimal and Gunaratne raised hopes of some sort of recovery but Gunaratne's run out put paid to that. Chandimal's wicket soon afterwards snuffed out any last hope that Sri Lanka had and the game was reduced to a formality around the 25-over mark.",South Africa won by 121 runs, ODI,South Africa vs Sri Lanka,2
"So close yet so far. But Sri Lanka finally played like an international team. After being pulped by du Plessis's career-best effort, Tharanga played like the leader Sri Lanka had craved on this tour. For most part of the innings, they were on top but South Africa had the belief. Such is the cruel story of big chases, nothing is enough. Even a brief phase of couple of wickets can dent prospects and that is what happened. Tahir went for some runs but chipped in with a few wickets when the tourists were closing in on the target. Nonetheless, the loss shouldn't dishearten the Lankans who, perhaps, played their best match on the tour and managed to score their highest ODI total in South Africa.",South Africa won by 40 runs, ODI,South Africa vs Sri Lanka,3
" Chasing 385, they lost 5 wickets inside 15 overs. A 97-run stand between Gunaratne and Pathirana followed, and then the former went all guns blazing towards the end, claiming his maiden ODI ton in the process. South African bowlers, bar Morris, were quite off radar today. Didn't turn up at all. Not particularly impressed with AB's captaincy for he didn't go for the kill once Sri Lanka lost half their side. ",South Africa won by 88 runs, ODI,South Africa vs Sri Lanka,2
"Phew, Sri Lanka win. A target of 170 wasn't intimidating on a good track but those three sixes by Mangaliso Mosehle in the last over threatened to really conspire against a contest. Didn't. Niroshan Dickwella's maiden fifty carried them. And so did Seekkuge Prasanna's cameo of 37 off 16 balls to sail Sri Lanka through. South Africa dropped a lot of catches. Like a lot. There was a time when they dropped three off three consecutive balls - some tough, some not so much. So they can't blame anyone but themselves. A really good game in the end to end an amazing T20I series",Sri Lanka won by 5 wkts, T20,South Africa vs Sri Lanka,4
"Winning is a habit; and if you have not developed it, it comes hard. Bangladesh were 105/1 in the 23rd over. While they were not completely in the driver's seat, they were not lagging either. Chase was on. The two set batsmen were Kayes (43) and Sabbir Rahman (38). Both seemed in no hurry, having bade their time. A horrendous run-out led way for senseless shot making and it was followed by some good deliveries from the hosts. The infamous collapse, which separates nervy teams from consistent ones, was making its presence felt. In the next 10 overs, they lost 6 wickets and added 40! That's it. New Zealand had throttled them. Formalities took a little while to get completed but Bangladesh's fate was sealed much earlier - first signs of which were two set batsmen running towards the same end... in the 23rd over. But remember this was not a self immolation by any stretch. New Zealand ployed that. Never lost the belief and bowled some tight lines. Easy runs were never on offer and that tightened the noose. And when the time was opportune, they cashed in to go 2-0 up in the series!",New Zealand won by 67 runs, ODI,New Zealand vs Bangladesh,4
"New Zealand finish Bangladesh off at a canter to complete a clean sweep. The pair of Williamson and Broom were brilliant in their 179-run partnership after the hosts got off to a slightly rocky start. Latham was dismissed early and Guptill was forced to retire hurt through an unfortunate hamstring injury. Bangladesh had the opportunity to remove Broom for nought, only for Kayes to spill a straightforward catch at slip. There was no coming back from there. At one stage, both batsmen looked set to get a century apiece. Eventually, neither did. Broom was foxed by Mustafizur to end up three runs short, whereas Williamson quite selflessly empowered Neesham to finish the game and himself remained unbeaten on 95.",New Zealand won by 8 wkts, ODI,New Zealand vs Bangladesh,2
"It was a sub-par total that looked all the more timid considering the batting might Australia possessed. But New Zealand started like a dream and before the tourists could realize they were 6 down. Recuperation is a painful process and it was not a different one today. Faulkner was being unlike himself. Took 36 balls to find the fence for the first time but managed to hang in and that is what Stoinis needed. Hope! That he got from his partner and as far as the belief was concerned, he had it much more than any guy playing his second ODI will have. With Faulkner leaving him mid-way, Stoinis unleashed all he had. Was supported by some mediocre fielding efforts and ordinary bowling. But just when it mattered the most, Williamson kept his calm and hit the target to make sure that New Zealand did not lose the greatest ODI match of 2017.",New Zealand won by 6 runs, ODI,New Zealand vs Australia,4
"What a game. Both sides had a sniff at a win once, both sides seemed to have bungled the advantage once, but both recovered.. New Zealand just enough to snatch home a 2-0 series win in the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy. 281 was an about-par score lacking intimidation, and at 44/0, Australia seemed to be on course Boult picked two in an over - eighth of the innings - and then Williamson's spell graduated into Australia's doom. He went for 11 runs in his first over, seven in the next, and then had a well-set Finch in his third. And from thereon, every over was an advocation of Williamson's immense self-belief and in his Sodhi's non-selection on a pitch expected to be slow.",New Zealand won by 24 runs, ODI,New Zealand vs Australia,4
"A typical T20 chase. More drama towards the back end, but eventually the better side emerged victorious. Tharanga's dismissal in the first over didn't dent the confidence of the youngsters; at least in terms of experience. Dickwella, Munaweera, Gunaratne went all guns blazing and piled almost 70 percent of the target. The rest of the total was all about holding your nerve and cruising past the finishing line. Any T20 game would be boring without a few jittery moments. Australia did create a few, thanks to Ashton Turner and Andrew Tye, but the young Lankan side had the final laugh.",Sri Lanka won by 5 wkts, T20,Australia vs Sri Lanka,4
"What a game this turned out to be. 5-1.. 22-2.. 27-3.. 40-4.. 40-5.. inside the fifth over and Sri Lanka have managed to pull off a win from there, gee! Let's be honest: on a pitch that was holding up right through, a target of 174 was above par. But then again, Sri Lanka are going through one of the phases that feels like Meryl Streep's Hollywood career. They just find ways to make a mark, and win. Kudos to Gunaratne for walking in when the match looked lost, persevering and timing the big hits when most people surrender to their nerves and give up. 50 runs were scored off the last three overs and an innings of 84 off 46 from Gunaratne took Sri Lanka to a mighty good series win. Great follow-up to the one in South Africa. Fun fact: Australia have never beaten Sri Lanka in a T20I on their home soil",Sri Lanka won by 2 wkts, T20,Australia vs Sri Lanka,5
"Dominant performance from the hosts. They were at it right from the start. Never allowed the Afghan innings to flourish; were definitely helped by the bouts of rain that hampered the momentum of tourists, if there were any. Coming into bat, there were not any hiccups. They got to a good start and despite a couple of wickets at the fag end, were able to get to the finish-line with ease.",Zimbabwe won by 7 wkts, ODI,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,2
"A big win for Afghanistan rounds up their third series win in Zimbabwe. The series was nicely poised at 2-2, with hosts boasting of all the momentum with two back-to-back wins. The Harare Sports Club was choked with people, only for Zimbabwe to yield to Afghanistan. And rains. And how! After Afghanistan's 253, rains arrived to delay the second innings and the revised target for Zimbabwe happened to be 161 off 22 overs, something which proved too tall. Dawlat Zadran and Amir Hamza ran riot at the top of the order, Zimbabwe panicked and lost the rest of the wickets to brain fog.",Afghanistan won by 106 runs (D/L method), ODI,Zimbabwe vs Afghanistan,3
"Phehlukwayo could pull it off the other day but today things were a little different. For most part of his innings, he was under the shadow of some mind-boggling hitting from Pretorius. But once Pretorius departed, things became a little too difficult for the tourists. Great come back from New Zealand. Having put just enough runs on the board, they got some early wickets but it was only when they got rid of Miller and ABD in quick succession, things started looking bright for them. However, before they could settle in, South Africa counterattacked to signal that the game was not over. In the end it required a classic over from Boult to seal the deal for the hosts.",New Zealand won by 6 runs, ODI,New Zealand vs South Africa,5
"Martin Guptill's comebacks make for great stories. This is another one. Replaced Latham at the top of the order and smacked 180* off just 138 balls - the highest ODI score by a New Zealand batsman against South Africa and the second highest individual score at Hamilton. This innings has been a treat to watch. He's been lucky but to play an innings like that, on a pitch as slow as this, takes something. Sometimes, you have to stand and applaud.",New Zealand won by 7 wkts, ODI,New Zealand vs South Africa,3
"A massive win. At the halfway mark, New Zealand looked favourites after restricting South Africa to 185/6. But then, Morris feasted on Glenn Phillips' debut nerves, bowling a double-wicket maiden to derail the chase in the very beginning, and some stubborn lack of application by the middle order caught New Zealand by surprise in the only T20I. Tahir, the World No. 1, had a five-for to his name and Phehlukwayo chipped in with three timely wickets: Williamson, Anderson and Santner.",South Africa won by 78 runs, T20,New Zealand vs South Africa,4
"Smiles all round. Bangladesh deserve this. They really do. They have out-batted, out-bowled and out-fielded Sri Lanka. Chasing 325 was always going to be an arduous task. Mortaza got Bangladesh off to a dream start, prising out Gunathilaka in the first over of the innings. Mendis and Tharanga followed him soon. Chandimal and Gunaratne steadied the ship for a while but the latter couldn't convert his start. Chandimal waged a lone battle but lost his wicket trying to up the ante. Thisara Perera struck some lusty blows towards the end but the ever mounting run-rate proved to be a demon and devoured the hosts. Earlier, on the back of Tamim's century and fifties from Shakib and Sabbir propelled Bangladesh to 324. They backed up their batsmen with some disciplined bowling and romped home with ease in the end.",Bangladesh won by 90 runs, ODI,Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh,3
"Sri Lanka level the series and also end their winless run of 7 matches in ODIs. They were the hungrier team today, right from the start of the match when Tharanga and Gunathilaka delivered a brisk start. Bangladesh clawed back in during the middle stages but Thisara Perera's fifty ensured a very competitive total of 280. That total started to look very big as Bangladesh were reduced to 11/3 with Kulasekara and Lakmal bowling splendidly well. Shakib and Sarkar entertained a brief counter-attack but once that was quelled, there was a flurry of wickets. Dilruwan Perera and Seekuge Prasanna found enough turn in the pitch to be brave enough to toss it up and wrecked Bangladesh's hopes. The match was killed halfway during the chase. Mehedi Hasan impressed lower down but it was always going to be in a losing cause. With this, Sri Lanka preserve the record of never losing an ODI series to Bangladesh.",Sri Lanka won by 70 runs, ODI,Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh,3
"West Indies were in the game but once Carlos Brathwaite was out in the 45th over, with West Indies needing 73 off 34 balls, the hosts lost out on an outside chance as well. Ben Stokes didn't bowl at all in the innings, but on a pitch where spinners should have thrived, Woakes and Plunkett shared eight wickets between them. West Indies looked the most comfortable when Rashid and Moeen bowled in tandem, but once the pacers took over, again, wickets fell - some to panic, some to sheer pace, or the lack of it.", England won by 45 runs, ODI,Windies vs England,4
"West Indies did look favourites once, when England lost 4 for 16. Morgan, Stokes, Buttler and Moeen were the wickets to fall in a heap but Holder erred in bowling out his spinners Bishoo and Nurse - the two responsible for the mid-innings collapse - as early as the 29th over, and then happened to be sheer unlucky in losing Gabriel to a side strain. Only three overs from his premier fast bowler didn't help, and so didn't dropped catches - some tough, some not so much. The pitch was turning big but Woakes and Root piled on an unbeaten 102-run stand for the sixth wicket and sailed England to a series win with a match to go.",England won by 4 wkts, ODI,Windies vs England,4
"Ireland will derive a lot of satisfaction from this win. After repeated collapses from the middle order during run-chases on this tour, they have finally managed to find a fix. Stirling played wonderfully well for his 99 to set the chase up, but his dismissal at a crucial juncture gave the sense that the same script would unfold all over again. It wasn't to be. Balbirnie was having none of it. The key to Ireland's success lay in how they kept Rashid Khan at bay. The leg-spinner, who previously spun circles around the Ireland batsmen, went wicketless today. The use of the sweep against him, especially from Balbirnie, stood out. When not sweeping, they played him late and nudged him around for singles. Once his threat was negated, the pitch was good enough for the target to be achieved comfortably. With this, Ireland stay alive in the ODI series.",Ireland won by 6 wkts, ODI,Afghanistan vs Ireland,3
"What a turnaround from Afghanistan! With this, they extend their winning streak in T20Is to 10 matches and also seal this series with a game to spare. The rain break might have disrupted Ireland's momentum, but take nothing away from Rashid Khan. The 18-year-old leg-spinner ran through the Irish middle and lower order to take a five-for inside two overs. It was his googly which did most of the damage as the panic-stricken batsmen failed to pick anything out of the hand.",Afghanistan won by 17 runs, T20,Afghanistan vs Ireland,5
"Afghanistan's winning streak lives on. They have now won 11 T20Is in a row. The match was set up with the bat; with Nabi and Shahzad registering brilliant performances. 234 was always going to be improbable. Credit to Ireland though for showing a lot of fight. Their openers, Stirling and Thompson, gave them a flier and propelled them ahead of the rate. But what Ireland really needed was for one of them to bat right through. That wasn't to be. Afghanistan kept chipping away at the wickets at crucial times which ensured that they were in control after the 10-over mark despite a valiant fifty from Wilson. Rashid Khan impressed once again by proving to be economical and wrapping it up towards the end with a triple-strike.",Afghanistan won by 28 runs, T20,Afghanistan vs Ireland,4
"What a turnaround for West Indies. Their bowlers set up the platform, restricting Pakistan to a meagre 137. And then their batsman - Evin Lewis never gave a whiff to the visitors with his belligerent 91. Rest of the batsmen played second fiddle to him. Lewis though fell at the doorstep of victory and it was Simmons, who applied the finishing touches, helping his side romp home with 37 balls to spare. West Indies have thrown life into this series now with this win. A rare off-day for Sarfraz and his boys. Must be a humiliating defeat for sure, but they just didn't have enough runs on the board.",West Indies won by 7 wkts, T20,Windies vs Pakistan,2
"An easy outing for the Englishmen who were at the top of the game. They have ticked most boxes today, starting with Adil Rashid who returned his maiden fifer in ODIs. Chasing was never going to be a headache and Hales's fifty made it a cakewalk. Root continues to churn up runs. Remained not-out on 49 and Bairstow provided finishing touches. Ireland have a lot to improve on. They needed to bring their A-game out against the mighty neighbours but could not really kick off after a decent start in the first five overs.",England won by 7 wkts, ODI,England vs Ireland,3
"In the end a comfortable win for South Africa but not before it exposed their inability to handle the ball when it does something off the track. England were a little complacent coming into the game. Ended up resting a few players and then lost 6 wickets inside 5 overs. From thereon it was always the catching-up game. Willey and Bairstow ensured that they had something to play but that was never enough. And after South Africa got off to a solid start, only formalities were needed. England have tested all their weapons so far. Might have finalized the team they would want to field in the Champions Trophy. Bairstow's innings today will only add to their belief.",South Africa won by 7 wkts, ODI,England vs South Africa,3
"When they decided to bat it was thought to be a brave move, when they somehow crawled to 212.. it was touted as something respectable. But a few hours later, they have had the last laugh. West Indies looked clueless in the chase, were too defensive to begin with and when Rashid Khan came to strike back to back, they were exposed further. Rashid Khan's bowling performance - 8.4-1-18-7 - today is also the 4th best bowling figures in ODIs and it has helped Afghanistan script their own little history.",Afghanistan won by 63 runs, ODI,Windies vs Afghanistan,3
"Is it a win? Well, on papers it surely is. But for a team that restricted the opposition on 135 and then wasted 6 wickets and almost 40 overs to get to the target on a pitch that did not have any demons, it is struggle. A struggle that does not reflect good on their reputation. In hindsight, Afghanistan would think that 50 more runs and they might have sealed the series. The harsh truth is no West Indian seems confident against Rashid Khan and that will be the imperious question worrying them a couple of days from now when they meet the visitors for the final clash.",West Indies won by 4 wkts, ODI,Windies vs Afghanistan,2
"The chase done and dusted without breaking sweat. Ask Marlon Samuels how? He launched himself time and again, taking calculated risks, and in the process produced a man of the match performance. He hit his highest score in T20Is, and not to forget Jason Mohammed's contribution who manoeuvred strike often making sure Samuels doesn't lose his rhythm. Those little things and Afghanistan's shabby fielding meant West Indies maintain a clean slate so far in the tour.",West Indies won by 7 wkts, T20,Windies vs Afghanistan,3
"When bad times reign, you find a way to lose. Sri Lanka had it all figured out, having stumbled their recent nemesis India from an unsurprising 109/0 to a stuttering 131/7. Dananjaya could have been the hero of his own script, having punched holes into India's middle-order experimentation with a six-wicket haul in his first innings against India. And then, Bhuvneshwar happened, matching every defence for an equally impregnable facial guise. His maiden ODI half-century not just distilled India out of an embarrasing loss but ramped them to a win, too, aptly twinning with a fidgety, cluelessly brilliant, innings from the ex-captain himself.",India won by 3 wkts (DLS method), ODI,Sri Lanka vs India,4
"This match, as much as I'd like for it to be otherwise, would probably be remembered for the wrong reasons. But let it not distract from how good this partnership has been. From a position of 61/4, with Dananjaya having struck twice in two overs, it had all the potential to go awry for India. But Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni have played wonderfully well to make it home at a canter. This is just the knock Rohit needed to get him into the groove for the season ahead, after he was rested from the Windies tour. And Dhoni, how good has he been in these last two games, allowing his partners to thrive with his calming influence at the other end in order to shepherd the team home. Let's not forget about Bumrah too, setting the game up with a five-for. What a series he's having!",India won by 6 wkts, ODI,Sri Lanka vs India,3
"Sri Lanka's chances of direct qualification into 2019 World Cup keeps getting grim with each passing game. While Chasing 375, losing 3 wickets inside 10 overs is the last thing you want. Sri Lanka's batsmen didn't display any application. Except Mathews, no-one showed any intent to spend some time at the crease. A couple of run-outs didn't help their cause either, and as a result, they find themselves on the verge of a whitewash against India.",India won by 168 runs, ODI,Sri Lanka vs India,2
"2-0 to England. West Indies can't win the series from here. It would have taken something really special for them to chase down 370, even with the pitch being as good as it was, and the boundaries being as short as they were. For a brief while, Gayle entertained prospects of producing that 'something special'. But that was before his running between the wickets let him down yet again. The innings didn't take time to disintegrate from there.",England won by 124 runs, ODI,England vs Windies,2
"Match abandoned, England win by DLS. It was literally in the last 20-30 minutes of the game that they robbed it from the West Indies, who would've felt in absolute control after reducing the hosts from 126/0 to 181/5. But Moeen Ali and Jos Buttler stunned them with a brutal onslaught, plundering 51 in the last four overs that were possible. Spare a thought for Alzarri Joseph, who became the youngest Windies fast bowler to take a five-for, and he did it in one spell. Even more so, spare a thought for Evin Lewis, who would have probably coasted to a double-century if he wasn't forced to retire-hurt on 176*. 3-0 to England with a game to go. ",England won by 6 runs (DLS method), ODI,England vs Windies,5
"A really smart turnaround from the Windies, after a forgettable powerplay. They quickly understood that change of pace was the key on this surface, and brought England down to a grinding halt after the Hales onslaught. It was the spinners who turned the tide when Windies were running for cover. Narine and Nurse, between them, took three wickets in three overs soon after they were introduced. The pacers followed suit with an assortment of slower balls, never allowing England to get away even when Bairstow and Buttler were building a little partnership. That pressure eventually got to the hosts and they fell apart towards the end.",Windies won by 21 runs, T20,England vs Windies,4
"Good performance from the Indians. These reduced games always help the team chasing. That wasn't the case today. Well, Australia's revised target was 164 in 21 overs. The visitors never got going in their chase. The Gujarati-duo of Hardik Pandya and Bumrah set the tone early in the innings with the new ball. When three of your top four fall for single digit scores, it'll always be a tough ask for the lower-middle order batsmen. Glenn Maxwell came out all guns blazing and he took special liking to Kuldeep Yadav hitting three successive sixes. However, he was soon scalped by Chahal, who finished with impressive figures: 5-0-30-3. Faulkner in the end tried his best with the bat, but it was too big a task for the Australian all-rounder.","India won by 26 runs (DLS method - reduced to 21 overs due to rain, target 164)", ODI,India vs Australia,3
"India go 2-0 up in the series. Their bowlers have done a fantastic job yet again to convincingly defend a total which was around par, you would imagine. This bowling group is functioning so brilliantly in tandem, with wicket-taking options from top to bottom. Bhuvneshwar Kumar set the tone with a masterclass of swing and seam bowling at the start, swinging circles around the Aussie batsmen and dismissing both openers cheaply. Smith and Head revived the innings for a while, but that was before the wrist-spinners took over again. Arguably, Chahal was the more impressive one with impeccable control over his flight, and he absolutely shackled the middle-order. But then Kuldeep just came back in and claimed a hat-trick for himself. Just shows the luxuries Virat Kohli possesses right now.",India won by 50 runs, ODI,India vs Australia,4
"When the rains came, the match was headed towards a potentially thrilling finish. This looked like the perfect opportunity for Manish Pandey and Kedar Jadhav to rise to the occasion and lift all the scrutiny they've recently been under. While they did impress briefly upon resumption, the duo threw it away and couldn't get the job done. It would be remiss of me to take any credit away from how the Australian pacers pulled things back at the death. Richardson, in particular, was super impressive with the variations in pace and lengths. So Australia have their first ODI win overseas after quite a while. Finch and Warner set it up with the bat, and then their pacers clinched it from a tight spot. They did need a slice of brilliance in the field from their captain to get rid of a fluent Rohit, who would've taken the game away quickly had he stayed any longer. We'll be hearing from him soon enough in the presentations..",Australia won by 21 runs, ODI,India vs Australia,4
"India and their chances were never in doubt. Only rain could have changed the outcome of this game. The game was won in the first innings with bowlers creating all sorts - on a tricky Ranchi pitch - to the Australian batsmen. It seemed as if rain might have the final say after it consumed nearly two hours of play. But once, it relented...India started off the chase with 'skates-on' mode. Two of India's best batsmen in the limited overs were on the extreme ends of a yawning run-chase. Rohit blazed the innings off with a four and Kohli capped with something similar.",India won by 9 wkts (Target 48 in 6 ovs due to rain - DLS method), T20,India vs Australia,3
"Smiles in the Pakistan camp. A perfect all-round performance from Sarfraz and Co. The players exchange handshakes as they walk off the field. This is Pakistan's fifth consecutive win. On the contrary, Sri Lanka's eighth consecutive ODI loss - their worst since 1999. After Pakistan set a target of 293, Lanka were always under the hammer. A ton from Babar and an attacking 81 from Malik had set the tone. The visitors started off on a quick note before Raees nipped out Dickwella and Chandimal. The latter ended up wasting the only review after he was given out LBW. Then the off-spinners took over and wickets continued to fall at regular intervals. Thirimanne complied a half-century and Dananjaya hung in there till the end with an unbeaten 50 - his first in ODIs. But could only reduce the losing margin; It turned out, they couldn't come anywhere close to the target as Pakistan romped home comfortably..",Pakistan won by 83 runs, ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,3
"Is there a better bowling unit than Pakistan when the surface aids them? Tough one to call. The wicket was two-paced and the ball was hardly coming on to the bat and the spin troika of Hafeez, Shadab and Malik made Sri Lanka submit meekly. The combined bowling figures read: 23-1-88-5. Dickwella and Mendis fell early to the pacers. Tharanga and Thirimanne defied proceedings with a dodgy stand, once that was broken the floodgates opened and the slide turned into a procession. The Sri Lankan skipper kept his side in the game with a scratchy hundred and 76-run 8th wicket stand but ran out of partners. At the end, he remained unbeaten and in the process became the first Sri Lankan opener to carry his bat in an ODI.",Pakistan won by 32 runs, ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,4
"If you have just tuned in, don't mistake this for a shortened game. Pakistan, right from the word go, were never short on intent; Usman Khan - playing his second game - wreaked havoc with the ball and inflicted insurmountable pressure on the Sri Lankan batting line-up in the opening burst, recording his maiden fifer in international cricket while at it. All that in the space of 6.3 overs. From that point, there was no room for recovery. Thisara Perera's 25 stood out in what seemed like an atrocious and apalling scorecard. A defeat that should scare the devil out of their system. For Pakistan, it was just a walk in the park. A sweet revenge after being cleanswept in the Test series.",Pakistan won by 9 wkts, ODI,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,3
"Another comprehensive performance from Pakistan. They've continued right where the left off from the ODI series. Their bowlers, all six of them, were among the wickets this evening to bundle Sri Lanka out for 102. And that was the game right there. There was a bit of a flutter early on with a couple of quick wickets. But the arrival of Shoaib Malik, who looked in absolutely brilliant touch, made it a cruise for the hosts. ",Pakistan won by 7 wkts, T20,Pakistan vs Sri Lanka,2
"Yet another one-sided affair. Everything went right for the hosts from the toss. Faf had no hesitations to bat on a belter and the batsmen took full advantage of it. The openers set the perfect foundation with a brisk century stand. Bangladesh, in the form of Mehidy Hasan, picked two quick wickets and that was the only moment in this match where Bangladesh found an opening. But, Bangladesh allowed their opponents to settle. du Plessis and Markran shared a century stand for the third wicket. Just when the South African skipper was approaching towards a ton, a lower back injury forced him to leave the field. Bangladesh were at their best with the ball in the final ten overs, but enough damage was done as the Proteas ended up posting their highest-ever ODI total versus Bangladesh.",South Africa won by 200 runs, ODI,South Africa vs Bangladesh,3
"If you weren't very excited going into this series, you should be now. New Zealand have created history at the Wankhede, largely without breaking a sweat (I say that metaphorically). They've done it through two extraordinary batting performances. When Tom Latham and Ross Taylor came together, the scenario was looking pretty grim for the visitors after losing three wickets in pretty much no time. But they didn't let the situation get to them. They rotated strike early, never allowed the spinners to dominate, and got the boundaries at timely intervals. India knew they were just one wicket away from getting into the inexperienced lower-order, but that wicket never came, not until the match was almost done.",New Zealand won by 6 wkts, ODI,India vs New Zealand,4
"What a thrilling game of cricket, and what a fitting finish to this series! A game which New Zealand will look back on as a missed opportunity to register a historic series win in India. They had it with Latham and Nicholls going strong, as deep as the 46th over mark. Especially with Latham looking in other-wordly touch. But lo and behold, Jasprit Bumrah, India's best bowler all evening, came back and bowled a couple of spectacular overs at the death. The pressure he exerted was enough for New Zealand to descend into panic, causing them to blow a golden opportunity. Almost making it a habit to pull off these cliffhangers in India's favour. Excellent yorker bowling.",India won by 6 runs, ODI,India vs New Zealand,5
"There are ways to reverse a 12-match losing streak, and then there is this. Hand India an absolute drubbing, with 176 balls and an entire sunset session going waste. Smiles, hugs, high fives in the Lankan dressing room..oh you've been missed. 113 was never going to be threatening, they did give the Indians a sniff, but Tharanga, his luck, and his edges sealed it. And Dickwella came in to have some fun. But that's only the icing. The real choclate in the cake came in the form of Lakmal's 10-4-13-4. Also India's desperation to seek practice sessions out of international games with batsmen of dodgy techniques.",Sri Lanka won by 7 wkts, ODI,India vs Sri Lanka,2
"Gosh, don't put down this win to just Sri Lanka's ineptitude. Yes, Indian bowlers had 180 odd runs to defend but they also had buckets of dew to contend with. Against two wristspinners bowling this late at Cuttack, Sri Lanka had equal stakes in the game, something that India's spinners chipped away with refreshing display of flight and spin, defying the dew like it never arrived. Rohit Sharma took his time between the overs, wiping the ball, and thus dictating the pace of the game. Undakat got the bowling off to a great start, flummoxing Sri Lanka with his cutters and the spin-twins, Chahal and Kuldeep, followed up beautifully. Six wickets between them, and that twinned with Dhoni-Pandey partnership towards the end sunk Sri Lanka.",India won by 93 runs, T20,India vs Sri Lanka,2
"Fair play to Kusal Perera for going after it, but come on, Sri Lanka were never in this. And then they collapsed dramatically, losing 8 wickets in 25 balls with India's wrist-spinners exacting their retribution for all the punishment suffered at the hands of Perera. With this win, India have now sealed the T20I series with a 2-0 lead. It was pretty much sealed at the halfway mark. Oh this was bad, even for Sri Lanka - after all their sufferings on this tour. Whatever soul they had left coming into Indore, Rohit Sharma destroyed it as he equalled the fastest T20I hundred.",India won by 88 runs, T20,India vs Sri Lanka,2
"A very convincing win for the Kiwis in the end. With the pitch easing out considerably as the game progressed, 248 was never going to be enough for the WI and that's what transpired. The new-look opening pair of Worker (stroked a fifty) and Munro did the damage upfront with a century stand in quick time to virtually kill the chase. Although both fell in successive overs, the middle order had no real pressure and they knocked off the runs rather easily despite losing a few more wickets along the way. Williamson got a start while Taylor was there till the end to see his side through. Debutant Astle made his dream debut more wonderful with a couple of power hits. For the Windies, debutant Beaton was the only impressive bowler while the others found their radar too late in the game to make any impact.",New Zealand won by 5 wkts, ODI,New Zealand vs Windies,3
"There's nothing Windies can take out of it. They have been outplayed in the series. Today was their best chance though. Rain never allowed New Zealand to gain the momentum and a curtailed match almost made it a T20 fixture, something which the Caribbeans love to be part of. However, it was a nightmarish start for them. Gayle went in the first over and it led to a procession that just did not stop. At one stage, they were 9/5 but Holder held one end and saved the blushes. Misery is over, at last.","New Zealand won by 66 runs (DLS method, reduced to 23 overs per side due to rain, target 166)", ODI,New Zealand vs Windies,2
"Not a win for Windies on this tour. Two Tests, 3 ODIs and 3 T20Is have fallen short of warming them up. Today's been another hammering. Started with Munro and Guptill racking up a 136-run stand and continued into the second innings, when Southee struck twice in his opening over accounting for the openers, Gayle being one of them. Andre Fletcher was the only player who looked like taking Windies close but Ish Sodhi set him up beautifully. And from there, all felt like a formality, much like this tour has",New Zealand won by 119 runs, T20,New Zealand vs Windies,2
"So Ireland equalise and in style. Having posted a decent enough total on this track, they never allowed the Afghans to get going. While the wickets were intact for a fair bit of time, the required run-rate kept going up, eventually sucking the Afghans into playing some nothing shots. Credit must be given to Irish fielders as well; they cut down on easy singles and maintained the pressure. After being outplayed in the first game, this is the kind of performance one would have expected from Ireland who now will have the momentum going into the final ODI two days from now.",Ireland won by 51 runs, ODI,Afghanistan vs Ireland,3
"After an absolute drag in the first half, we were treated to some mindful and serene batting from Ireland. Paul Stirling took it upon himself to anchor this chase with a calm head on his shoulders; stitching a pivotal 62-run stand with Balbirnie for the second wicket and thereby, blocking Afghanistan's hopes of a comeback. The stocky right-hander went gung-ho against Shapoor Zadran who ended up conceding 71 - nearly 40 percent of the target - off the 7 overs he bowled. The momentum Ireland gathered in the last game certainly worked wonders and they now have clinched their maiden bilateral series win against Afghanistan.",Ireland won by 5 wkts, ODI,Afghanistan vs Ireland,3
"That's a comprehensive win for West Indies to begin this tour after losing both their warm-up matches to India A. Smith gave a strong start, and that stand between Samuels and Ramdin took them past 300. India were definitely capable of chasing that, but some tight bowling from Rampaul, and disciplined lines from medium-pacers put India in trouble at 114 for 5. Samuels also got two wickets and whatever Ambrose said in the team huddle during the innings break seems to have worked",West Indies won by 124 runs, ODI,India vs Windies,3
"So Sri Lanka have fallen apart in this massive chase of 364. Their openers were troubled a lot by all three pacers - Umesh, Aaron and Ishant. Making a comeback, Ishant bowled beautifully to remove Dilshan and Sanga. Their hopes rested on Jayawardene then as he found gaps regularly before the spinners struck and removed him too. Akshar Patel was very economical to give India their second biggest win against Sri Lanka.",India won by 169 runs, ODI,India vs Sri Lanka,3
"Hasan Khan had struck with his first ball and struck with what turned out to be the last ball of the match. And resultingly, Quetta Gladiators have defended a total that looked severly below par, especially when McCullum and Roy walked out to open. And at 34/0 inside the third over, you could have sensed an easy chase, until Babar struck to send Roy back. Left-arm spinners then took over, sharing six wickets between them to conspire a mid-innings collapse from 34/0 to 77/6.

Malan and Morgan fought through that, then through tight uber-spells from Abrar Ahmed and Imad Wasim, and managed to forge a stand that kept Peshawar afloat.

"What an incredible performance from the Southern Stars. They recovered from a sluggish start and posted a good total on the board. And later during their bowling, after New Zealand had got to a good start, managed to regroup and choke the run-flow. Regular wickets ensured that the White Ferns' innings never took the pace and in the end it seemed all too easy for the hosts.",Australia Women won by 40 runs, T20,Australia Women vs New Zealand Women,3
The Southern Stars' nightmare comes to an end. The chase started off with a run-out and ended with a run-out. In between was some very poor strokeplay from the Australian batters. They lost half their side with the score reading just nine. The seamers Tahuhu and Huddleston were brilliant with the new ball picking up two wickets each. Then the White Ferns' spinners never allowed their opposition to get back into the game. A 47-run win is a mammoth victory in T20s.,New Zealand Women won by 47 runs, T20,Australia Women vs New Zealand Women,3
"Felt like an easy win but it's been achieved in the last over. Quetta Gladiators win two in two, and Karachi Kings lose two in two. 159 always looked 20 runs short and so it proved to be. Despite two wickets by Sohail Khan in the third over, Rilee Rossouw rallied on, stitching a 130-run stand with Sarfraz off 90 balls. Karachi needed more wickets upfront but Sohail Khan's the only one who struck in the match for them.",Quetta Gladiators won by 7 wkts,T20,Quetta Gladiators vs Karachi Kings,3
"This has been surreal. You expected an easy chase with the target being 60. Not to be. McCullum was audacious with his captaincy, employing two slips, two gullies and even a short leg at times, phenomenally inspiring his bowlers, so much so that Yasir Shah finished with figures of 4-0-7-4. Peshawar started looking completely incapacitated to score a run in the Narine-wrecked powerplay - ending it at 20/2 - and then the wickets started to tumble even more so. There were times when you thought McCullum could pull off a heist, especially after Morgan's wicket was a sheer slice of luck, but the total just wasn't enough. In hindsight, a total of 100 would have been match-winning.",Peshawar Zalmi won by 3 wkts,T20,Peshawar Zalmi vs Lahore Qalandars,3
"A chase that ebbed and flowed. Cameron Delport picked five boundaries off an Asghar over to kick-start the chase the McCullum-way. He was caught and bowled by Hasan Ali and that triggered a stunning collapse. Five wickets were lost in 11 balls for just 1 run. From 38/0 to 39/5 in an eye-blink. Then a Hafeez delivery spun the other way, taking out Rizwan too and all looked lost. Yamin and Narine put up a quick-fire 45-run stand for the seventh wicket but the run-rate kept creeping up, despite their heroics, gradually shoving Lahore to the brink of a loss.",Peshawar Zalmi won by 17 runs,T20,Peshawar Zalmi vs Lahore Qalandars,2
"T20 cricket and its tricks. You just have to give it for the format. Today seemed to be a day destined for panic attacks. What a day of cricket we've had. Quetta were cruising after KP and Shehzad engineered a near match-winning 139-run stand for the second wicket, but some illogical tactics from Quetta twinned with some terrific bowling from Islamabad United meant the latter pulled off a heart-stopper. There's no room for complacency. Not in cricket, not in life. Period!",Islamabad United won by 1 run,T20,Quetta Gladiators vs Islamabad United,4
"What a great match. And that's what context does. Karachi had a lot riding on this win - a loss would have shoved them out of the tournament but Pollard's 20-ball 45 has managed to assuage the embarrassment off three panic-ridden run-outs in the innings. McCullum used as many as eight bowlers, including himself but Pollard was plain unstoppable in the end. 28 was nneded off the last 2 overs and they get their off the last over. Only few things in life are more dramatic. Pollard's innings couldn't be more different to Babar Azam's, which was about timing and placement, but both twinned together to really give it their all for Karachi. What a game, again.",Karachi Kings won by 5 wkts,T20,Lahore Qalandars vs Karachi Kings,4
"Wasim Akram and Deano are all pumped up. Misbah has a big grin on his face. In the first game more than 400 runs were scored, a total of 200 was chased down with an over to spare and here we are witnessing a nail-biting bonzer of a contest. Chasing 137, Islamabad United found their way to break out of the jail. Credit to fast bowlers from both sides, who made this encounter lively. Barring Smith, there was only one batsman who touched 30. Watto it was. Smith too struggled, but once he found his touch, there was no stopping. Just when they seemed cruising, Wahab Riaz and Hasan Ali bowled their hearts out to make it an edge-of-the-seat encounter. But to defend 6 off the final over is too hard a task",Islamabad United won by 5 wkts,T20,Islamabad United vs Peshawar Zalmi,4
"How did Peshawar Zalmi lose this? Hafeez and Malan put on 139 for the third wicket, which happens to be the highest ever in PSL. Tymal Mills was going through one of this bad spells, spraying deliveries down leg to add to his team's miseries. All looked done and dusted until Nawaz had Hafeez caught in the deep. Malan followed suit eight balls later, falling to Mills, but then Afridi exploded. 35 off only 13 balls that saw one boundary and four big - really big! - sixes. Just 8 off 7 balls were needed then, a win still looked imminent, when Nawaz was handed the ball, much to everyone's surprise. Three wickets fell in the last over. Sammy denied a single first ball, a catch fell short of Mills off the second, an inside-edge off the third. 2 off 3 needed. Then two wickets off two balls. 2 off 1 needed. A super over is possible. Definitely. But guess what, it was another run-out, driven by panic. And thus, another match was lost to nerves.",Quetta Gladiators won by 1 run, T20,Peshawar Zalmi vs Quetta Gladiators,5
"This was expected to be a stroll in the park for Islamabad United as it was for them in the previous edition. It wasn't this time around. Chasing a below-par score of 127, Islamabad didn't get off to an auspicious start. They lost the recently retired Dwayne Smith and Haddin to Amir in the third over and didn't quite recover from there. There was a mini partnership between Misbah and Asif Ali for the third wicket. Once that was broken by Imad Wasim, it was all one-way traffic. The spin duo of Wasim and Usama Mir squeezed the flow of runs picking up regular wickets, and their combined figures of 6/42 proved to be the difference. Amir and Sohail came back to wrap up the tail. ",Karachi Kings won by 44 runs, T20,Islamabad United vs Karachi Kings,2
"Darren Sammy's force take off. They sprint across the circumference to acknowledge the support from this housefull crowd. Karachi Kings, who lost 4 wickets inside 9 overs, were always behind the eight ball. The run rate kept mounting as Gayle struggled to find rhythm. Once Pollard came out to the middle, Gayle found his mojo and that was the only phase where Kings threatened to dominate. Wahab Riaz dismissed both at crucial junctures of the game making Imad Wasim's cameo negligible. Kamran Akmal's sparkling ton was well backed up by the Zalmi's bowlers. Wahab Riaz and Chris Jordan, in particular who bagged 3 wickets apiece",Peshawar Zalmi won by 24 runs, T20,Peshawar Zalmi vs Karachi Kings,3
"When 4 of your top 6 batsmen get out without reaching double digits, you don't deserve to win. Not a final at least. Peshawar Zalmi's strength has been bowling all throughout the season and this win will stand as a testimony for why they have been crowned champions. The pitch got a little better for bowling in the second half, but when you lose half the side inside 8 overs, it's tough to make a comeback. Also Quetta had 4 new foreign players which didn't help their cause. Apart from Sarfraz and Sean Ervine no-one got going, surrendering meekly with 21 balls to spare. Wasn't a fitting final, but cricket won, Pakistan cricket won and all THAT build-up leading into the game came out trumps. Hang on for the most important moments of the season.",Peshawar Zalmi won by 58 runs,T20,Quetta Gladiators vs Peshawar Zalmi,2
"Before we get into anything else, just take a moment to applaud the death bowling from Sunrisers Hyderabad. Bhuvi was absolutely brilliant there to kill the game off towards the end along with Nehra. To be fair, RCB were a long way off and needed 69 with only five overs left. But the Indian pace duo absolutely shut the door on them. Rashid Khan bowled well on IPL debut too, picking up two crucial wickets as well. Chasing 208, RCB had got off to a decent start through Gayle and Mandeep, but neither of those two could kick on. In fact, all of their top five batsmen scored over 20 but just couldn't get that substantial score to win the game. All in all, a solid showing from the defending champions.",Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 35 runs, T20,Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore,3
"There was always an inevitability to the game. Pune were always going to get home if Smith stayed the course. Bumrah's penultimate over threatened to reverse that script. He left Pollard with 13 in the bank. Nerves would have certainly jangled as the final over began with just 3 singles. However, how dare anybody ever doubt what the Aussie, and now, Pune skipper can do. With 10 needed in 3 balls, Smith clobbered a couple of sixes to seal the win. They should have got home much earlier after a flying start from Rahane and his partnership with Smith which set the game up beautifully. Stokes chipped in with a useful cameo in the middle too. Mumbai fought back after that but Smith stood firmly in the way. They weren't getting one over him tonight.",Rising Pune Supergiant won by 7 wkts, T20,Rising Pune Supergiant vs Mumbai Indians,3
"A royal shellacking for the Gujarat Lions! My word, did we see a show tonight?! Lynn and Gambhir made a complete mockery of the total of 183 and chased it down with 31 balls to spare. Theirs is the highest partnership for KKR in the IPL. What a masterstroke to send Lynn at the top of the order. He sent shockwaves through the bowling attack in the powerplay and Gujarat didn't have it in them to recover. Even Gambhir. You'd think that with all the carnage at the other end, Gambhir would have gone under the radar. But the KKR skipper completely held his own and got himself going with some stunning shots. Gujarat clearly lack quality in that bowling attack. Apart from Praveen Kumar, who is a class apart, there's absolutely no one the skipper can rely upon when the going gets tough. Some serious thinking to be done as to what combination they field from now on..",Kolkata Knight Riders won by 10 wkts, T20,Gujarat Lions vs Kolkata Knight Riders,3
"What a game we've had here in Bangalore. RCB appeared to be short by 20-25 runs at the halfway stage but their bowlers stepped it up tonight. What stood out was that they looked for wickets right through. The quicks were intense, the spinners were aggressive and DD just kept faltering along the way. You've got to feel for Rishabh Pant who fought so valiantly out there and was waging a lone battle in the second half of that chase. He's certainly one to watch out for. Chahal and Watson were brilliant under pressure though. The scoreboard clearly reflects how Delhi's middle order completely buckled when subjected to the cauldron of the Chinnaswamy. Only four DD players managed to get into double digits. Their batting depth had evoked a lot of concern going into this campaign and this result highlighted it further.",Royal Challengers Bangalore won by 15 runs, T20,Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Delhi Daredevils,4
"Nitish Rana and Hardik Pandya have pulled off a coup at the Wankhede. Mumbai looked to be gone after Pollard was dismissed and they still had to get 49 from 3 overs. But a scintillating fifty from Nitish Rana followed by a blinding cameo from Hardik Pandya has scripted the improbable. KKR will look back at those fielding errors in the final over. They couldn't have timed those errors any worse. Things could have been so different. But take nothing away from what we've witnessed here tonight. A special, special victory from out of nowhere.",Mumbai Indians won by 4 wkts,T20,Mumbai Indians vs Kolkata Knight Riders,4
"So, where did it go wrong for RCB? Watson won toss and opted to bat, lost 3 wickets inside the powerplay. If not for ABD, they would have been left embarrassing with a paltry total. He came out, stayed ahead of the game, and ensured he was there till the end. Scored 89 off 46, and the rest 55 off 74. I think that's where the game was lost. Striking under 100 in T20s is almost an unacceptable crime. RCB did commit and paid hefty. The chase wasn't a typical hustle-bustle approach from KXIP. Not until Maxi came and forced things. The ever-reliable Amla struck a fifty to make things more memorable.",Kings XI Punjab won by 8 wkts,T20,Kings XI Punjab vs Royal Challengers Bangalore,3
"This is Mumbai's yard, the Wankhede. They have one of the better home records in IPL cricket, and this performance goes on to show why. Sunrisers have now lost all three matches they've played here. Right from the top-down, they never got going. Warner and Dhawan may have put up a fifty-run opening stand but Mumbai still maintained good control and never let things slip. That pressure manifested in SRH's collapse from 105/1 to 158/8. A target of 159 was never going to be enough at this venue, especially with the dew. Rashid and Bhuvneshwar stood out once more but a few good cameos from Parthiv, Krunal and Rana is all it took for Mumbai to cruise home.",Mumbai Indians won by 4 wkts,T20,Mumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad,3
"The owners are happy and so are the players. It's been a thrilling night of cricket. After Andrew James TYE-D RPS with a hat-trick, and an eventual fifer, it was always tough to plot a comeback. They were off to a blazing start, but Smith's untimely wicket exposed the vulnerability in the middle order. Tiwary and Ankit slogged a few, but against the likes of B-MAC, Smith and Finch it was never going to be enough. As Steven Smith reckons in the post-match presentation they ""were 20 runs short."" RPS revamped their bowling line-up for this game, but there's no change in fortunes. Their bowlers were left clueless with GL batsmen going crash-bang-wallop from ball one...",Gujarat Lions won by 7 wkts,T20,Gujarat Lions vs Rising Pune Supergiant,4
"During the innings break, Uthappa mentioned that the pitch would play better batting second. That, however, didn't seem to be the case though as SRH struggled to find boundaries in the first 6 overs. Things didn't improve much after the powerplay either. They seemed okay with Warner and Dhawan showing some willingness to engineer a solid foundation at the top. But, once the spinners arrived, they were tied down with some terrific accuracy which led to the stem of run-flow, inserting extra pressure on the batsmen to follow. Yuvi did exhibit a glitter of his class, but it didn't last long. Overall, they lost by 17 runs on a track where Uthappa scored 68 off 39. Just saying. Period!",Kolkata Knight Riders won by 17 runs,T20,Kolkata Knight Riders vs Sunrisers Hyderabad,3
"A comprehensive win for Zaheer and his lads. Once Corey Anderson produced the big finish to take DD to 188, KXIP were always up against it. It was a score which has never been chased down here, right through the history of IPL. Punjab needed a good start with the bat. But Shahbaz Nadeem ensured that the visitors were always playing catch up as he struck in consecutive overs in powerplay. Morgan looked good but he found the fielder at the wrong time. Miller struggled right through and the rate shot up beyond 12 even before Maxi came to the crease. It was too much pressure against a quality attack. The deal was sealed when Mishra dismissed the Punjab skipper for a duck. Axar Patel played a good little knock towards the end but it was always going to be in a losing cause.",Delhi Daredevils won by 51 runs,T20,Delhi Daredevils vs Kings XI Punjab,3
"Absolutely brilliant performance from the RPS bowlers. They read the conditions beautifully and found a method to strangle the opposition. The ploy was to bowl slower back of length deliveries right into the pitch and the RCB batsmen just couldn't find a counter to it. The home side had initially got off to a decent start against the new ball which was coming on much better. That's where a lot of credit must go to Tahir for changing the course of the game and building pressure with a brilliant spell which included the wicket of AB de Villiers. Stokes chipped in with timely wickets of Kohli and Watson. And Unadkat and Thakur, who might have been the major worries going into this, stepped up magnificently at the death on a pitch which was slowing rapidly.",Rising Pune Supergiant won by 27 runs,T20,Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Rising Pune Supergiant,3
"Bloody hell, what a game! Manan Vohra played the knock of his life to turn the game around just when it seemed buried and nearly pulled off a single-handed heist. But after playing a magical innings and with the finish line within sight, he faltered off a low full toss. To say that he didn't deserve to be on the losing side would be an understatement. On the flip side, Bhuvneshwar Kumar definitely deserved to be on the winning side. The execution under pressure from the medium pacer, who is racking up the wickets in this IPL, was phenomenal. It really came down to Bhuvneshwar vs Vohra in that penultimate over, and that's where the battle was decided.",Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 5 runs,T20,Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Kings XI Punjab,5
"RCB win, finally. And away from home, coming on the back of three consecutive defeats, and do so on a day when AB de Villiers succumbed to his perennial back injury, yet again. The game was set by a high first innings score. Gayle went berserk at the top, Kohli played the nurdler, and then Kedar took over. A 16-ball 38 that took the score past 200, and perhaps the game beyond Gujarat, despite McCullum keeping them alive for most parts of this chase. Raina was all grace, but had a stint too short win a game. Ishan Kishan's 39 off 16 seemed delayed by all that was ahead of him, and this innings screamed for a rank higher up the order. Next game maybe, Ishan. Maybe. There's a long waiting line in front, remember?",Royal Challengers Bangalore won by 21 runs,T20,Gujarat Lions vs Royal Challengers Bangalore,4
"DD were in a comfortable position at the end of 9 overs. What followed was quite dramatic. An over from Yuvraj Singh turned things around in SRH's favour, but the chase never seemed out of reach. Shreyas Iyer was striking it at 160ks and all he needed was an able ally at the other end. Guess that's what went missing tonight. Also, the execution of death bowling from Sunrisers was terrific. Siddarth Kaul, the hero a couple of nights ago, yet again justified Warner's decision and held his nerve to complete the formalities.",Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 15 runs,T20,Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Delhi Daredevils,3
"Gujarat were off to a flier from Finch and McCullum. But that rain interruption at the five-over mark threatened to derail their run-chase completely as KKR started off really strong after the resumption. That's when Raina stepped up to the plate. Despite wickets tumbling around him, the Gujarat skipper played a magnificent knock to propel his team to the door of victory. He steered the chase almost single-handedly during that middle period, getting boundaries at regular intervals to ease the pressure of the run-rate. He finally found some support from Jadeja and their partnership sealed the game for the visitors. The bowlers for KKR, who are usually really good at home, had an off-day with most of them, barring Kuldeep Yadav, taking a beating.",Gujarat Lions won by 4 wkts,T20,Kolkata Knight Riders vs Gujarat Lions,4
"There's a reason why they say that great players can never be written off. MS Dhoni's painful struggles in this IPL have caused a lot of concern, but when it came down to it, the champion batsman turned it on in style. It's not for nothing that he's known as one of the best finishers in our game. He took some time to find his stride, but when he went into overdrive, even SRH's best bowler in Bhuvneshwar had no answers. At one stage, around the 16th over mark, it looked as if Dhoni had left it too late. But it's never too late with Dhoni. We've seen it all these years. We should have seen it coming today too. What a fantastic knock.",Rising Pune Supergiant won by 6 wkts,T20,Rising Pune Supergiant vs Sunrisers Hyderabad,4
"It started on a shaky note for Gujarat when McCullum missed a full toss. Raina and Finch had done well to steady the ship for a while when the storm struck. Cariappa's two in two in the middle of the chase almost shut the doors on the hosts. From 95/3 to 102/6, it all happened too quickly. So quickly that Dinesh Karthik never got the time to think his strategies. Punjab's death bowling had been a concern so far in the tournament but today things were a bit different. The slower balls were sent down the right line making shot-making too tough for the Gujarat batsmen. The loss means that Gujarat continue to be the bottom dwellers in the table.",Kings XI Punjab won by 26 runs,T20,Gujarat Lions vs Kings XI Punjab,3
"Well, would you believe it? A batting lineup comprising of Gayle, Kohli, AB de Villiers has been shot out for the lowest IPL score ever. Not one batsman managed to get into double digits. At the halfway stage, it looked like RCB had done pretty well to keep KKR down to 131. But KKR were just unstoppable with the ball. Nathan Coulter-Nile proved too hot to handle and ripped the game right open with a quick 3-fer. Then the way Woakes nipped the ball around, he might have well been bowling in England. RCB just couldn't handle the pressure and were blown away by the storm created by this full-house and the collective fire of NCN, Woakes, Umesh and de Grandhomme on a pitch which had definitely freshened up with the little evening sprinkle.",Kolkata Knight Riders won by 82 runs,T20,Kolkata Knight Riders vs Royal Challengers Bangalore,3
"Another disappointing batting performance from RCB. Their top-order caved once more and that momentum was never reversed. 134 would have taken some defending here, even with the tacky nature of the pitch. Samuel Badree gave some hope by getting rid of both GL openers cheaply, but it was snuffed out pretty quickly by a rampaging Finch who played at a different level and smoked a half-century in just 22 balls on a pitch where most batsmen struggled. Raina tagged along playing an unusually scratchy knock, probably jolted by the little bump he took on the shoulder in the field. But he managed to find his fluency towards the end and closed the game off. A comprehensive win for GL in the end. As for RCB, they can only get to seven wins at best. They might be out of the race already, barring something really spectacular.",Gujarat Lions won by 7 wkts,T20,Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Gujarat Lions,4
"KKR solidify their position at the top of the table with another clinical showing. Their bowlers did extremely well to pull things back at the death of the first innings by taking wickets, after DD were primed for a big finish. And then Uthappa and Gambhir ensured another comfortable run-chase with a significant second-wicket partnership. They really like batting together, those two. Zaheer Khan pulled his hamstring early in the piece which didn't help. The killer blow came when Uthappa was dropped early in his innings. At that time, Rabada was in full steam having just cleaned up Narine. There's no telling how different things could have been had that chance been gobbled. But there was no looking back from that point on. Uthappa went on to notch his fourth half-century this season, playing another majestic innings to take the game away at the rate of knots. DD, meanwhile, have slipped to their fourth consecutive loss.",Kolkata Knight Riders won by 7 wkts,T20,Kolkata Knight Riders vs Delhi Daredevils,4
"The trio of Dhawan, Warner and Williamson set things up with the bat, and the bowlers did enough to overcome a valiant effort from Shaun Marsh to seal the win. Rashid Khan and Bhuvneshwar Kumar were brilliant once again, registering superb figures in a game where stopping runs proved to be difficult on a belter of a pitch. At no stage during the chase did it feel like SRH were not in control, which can be credited to Rashid's spell which ensured that the required rate shot up over 14 with six overs still left. Even at his best, Marsh wasn't able to take the attack to the Afghanistan leggie as he just didn't pick him most of the time. He upped the ante later on but it was too much to do for a lone man. Nothing much of note from the Kings XI other than Marsh's effort, and maybe Guptill's little burst at the top. SRH register their first away win of the season.",Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 26 runs,T20,Kings XI Punjab vs Sunrisers Hyderabad,3
"Handshakes all round. Guptill pumps his fists in delight. The entire Kings XI Punjab are up on their feet and all smiles in the dug-out. They have made a mockery of this chase. An absolute thrashing. Delhi hardly had anything on the board. A score of 67 in a T20 match, even though the pitch was aiding the bowlers, was never going to be enough. This was an annihilation. As comprehensive as it gets. Guptill never gave a whiff, came out all guns blazing and reached his fifty in style. Amla played the anchors role and the hosts wolfed down the target with 73 balls to spare.",Kings XI Punjab won by 10 wkts,T20,Kings XI Punjab vs Delhi Daredevils,3
"A perfect game for the hosts. And coming on a day when even rains failed to play spoilsport. And if you ask me, all they did was to puncture a chase when Manish Pandey and Robin Uthappa were going strong. Not quite as strong as nailing the run-chase - definitely not! - but KKR had hope then. Once Uthappa fell, being brilliantly hoodwinked by Siraj's pace, or the lack of it, the innings stuttered. And so did KKR, losing for the first time in six games while chasing. A word of praise for Kaul, who brilliantly scalped Gambhir up front, and so brilliantly that it ruffled Uthappa's feathers, triggering him into a little spat that Yuvraj didn't like. Well, of course.",Sunrisers Hyderabad won by 48 runs,T20,Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Kolkata Knight Riders,3
"Now this is a stunning win, recovering from the shambles of 10/3, and then 42/4. Sangwan had a pretty comeback, striking twice in his first over and sending a tizzy down Pune's spine early in the game. What stood out was the pace and bounce he extracted, getting Steven Smith out with a top-edged pull. Should suggest a lot, given Umesh and Shami and Ishant tried all winter long. Ben Stokes walked in ahead of Dhoni, and outlived him at the crease, bruting a stunning 103 off 63 balls to take his side home. Thampi threatened to turn the tables around, when he scalped Dhoni with a slower ball in the seventeenth over. Pune looked done there, because Dhoni had consumed 33 balls for his 26, but Stokes took over brilliantly, unleashing at the right time. Thampi's last over quite ironically conceded 17 runs, which had two sixes from Stokes, and that changed the game. Just eight runs were needed from six, and bam, Pune were over the line.",Rising Pune Supergiant won by 5 wkts,T20,Rising Pune Supergiant vs Gujarat Lions,5
"Delhi win! And Delhi win contrary to popular opinion. The opinion which gained force after the first innings was over. 185 was a good score considering how the ball was holding up at the fag end of Hyderabad's innings. But the hosts got the start that is needed to take these kind of totals down. Samson was fluent as ever and finally captain Nair too found a few off the middle of the bat. Shreyas Iyer batted in his usual manner and Corey Anderson came good after ages. Delhi's batting efforts were helped by some predictable bowling from Hyderabad. The bowlers were generally short and bowled too many slower deliveries. This could have been over much early had the batters not missed out one some juicy full tosses. Nonetheless, a sweet win for Delhi. Hyderabad, on the other hand, lose another away-game.",Delhi Daredevils won by 6 wkts,T20,Delhi Daredevils vs Sunrisers Hyderabad,3
"Handshakes all around! Steve Smith, obviously, the happiest. He has every reason to be so. KKR were always behind the eight ball. Agreed chasing is their strength, but they cannot be drooling over that fact and forget winning matches when they bat first. Their batting hasn't quite fired, with Uthappa's absence clearly felt throughout.",Rising Pune Supergiant won by 4 wkts,T20,Kolkata Knight Riders vs Rising Pune Supergiant,2
"When Raina was dropped thrice in the first innings, thoughts of Delhi winning weren't fashionable. And they assumed impossible proportions when opener Karun Nair, also the captain, edged an upper-cut to the keeper, getting himself into an embarrassing tangle. But what followed was perhaps Dravid: Rishabh Pant came out to bat at No.3. He missed his first ball, picking it off his pads but that was it for the night. 6 fours and 9 sixes followed in a stunning partnership with Sanju Samson, that connived not only Delhi's highest chase that's also the highest at Kotla, and the second-highest in the IPL ever, but also dumped Gujarat Lions out of IPL 2017. A target of 209 tonight wasn't enough -- what's the day today, eh?",Delhi Daredevils won by 7 wkts,T20,Delhi Daredevils vs Gujarat Lions,4
"""Disheartening"" is the word Kohli used at the start of his post-match talk. That sums it up. The fans turned out in great numbers. They know RCB have no chance of qualifying. They know no-one had a great season with the bat. After the first half, however, the stadium had a bit of positivity oozing around as RCB needed 139 to win. A batting line-up that boasts of Kohli, ABD and Gayle. All three charged out to Sandeep Sharma and sold their wickets. After that it has been all downhill. The batting collapse, lesser described, the better. For KXIP, they now have to win at least 3 out of their 4 remaining games to have a hope of finishing in the top four.",Kings XI Punjab won by 19 runs,T20,Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Kings XI Punjab,2
"What a night for Mumbai. They have qualified for the play-offs. Played like table toppers. First put a mountain on the board and then crushed the opponents under the weight of the total. The chase was always going to be tough, like Harsha Bhogle said after the first innings. But even an ardent Mumbai fan would not have thought that this will turn out to be such an easy affair. Samson departed first ball and when Pant left without troubling the scorers, the door had almost shut on the hosts. This loss makes things really difficult for Delhi. They now no more are the controllers of their fate as their progress in the tournament will depend on whether or not others peform horrendously.",Mumbai Indians won by 146 runs,T20,Delhi Daredevils vs Mumbai Indians,3
"Another humbling defeat for RCB. Head's maiden fifty had given them respectability on what was another sluggish Chinnaswamy wicket, but there was nothing sluggish about what followed. Whether that little bit of rain during the first innings quickened the wicket is up for debate, but Narine and Lynn absolutely smoked the bejeezus out of the bowling. It was the ultimate thrill-ride if batsmen going bonkers is how you like your T20 cricket. Quite stunningly, as destructive as Lynn was, Narine managed to upstage him with the joint fastest fifty in IPL history, coming off just 15 balls. Spare a thought for the RCB. They must have thought that the worst was behind them. Now it is.",Kolkata Knight Riders won by 6 wkts,T20,Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Kolkata Knight Riders,4
"What has Amla done to deserve this? Both his centuries this season have ended up on the losing side. Punjab looked short on intent tonight. Sandeep's round the wicket fiasco killed the momentum, if there was any. And from there on started the slide that had everything disastrous - dropped catches, overthrows. This loss makes things a little difficult for Punjab who would have hoped to get close to Hyderabad in the points table.",Gujarat Lions won by 6 wkts,T20,Kings XI Punjab vs Gujarat Lions,2
"Now how did Punjab manage to haul this back in? A Narine and Lynn show - another one, yes - had popped the powerplay score to 61/1. It all looked set for Kolkata. They were off to an uber good start and chasing on a ground where dew normally arrives to hasten chases. But it didn't, tonight. And it meant that the spinners, Tewatia and Axar could bowl in tandem, choking the runs in the middle overs. Pacers had leaked runs up front, so when Sandeep came in to bowl the sixteenth over, taking over from Tewatia, there were concerns. But they soon waned into oblivion, as Sandeep and then particularly Mohit bowled yorkers, changed pace cleverly and choked KKR completely.",Kings XI Punjab won by 14 runs,T20,Kings XI Punjab vs Kolkata Knight Riders,4
"Phew! What a game of cricket. Handshakes all-round. Agony for Mumbai, ecstasy for Punjab. Sensational comeback by the hosts, but couldn't quite cross the finish line. Chasing 231 was always going to be an arduous task. They were off to a blazing start, Parthiv and Simmons plundered the bowlers to all parts of the ground. They were coasting all well and kept things under control. However, Punjab clawed back by removing both openers in quick succession. From there, Mumbai continued to lose wickets in clusters. All batsmen came in and got starts but none could convert them into a big score. Pollard and Pandya kept the belief in the MI camp with their big hitting but in the end, the ever-mounting run rate proved to be the demon and devoured the hosts. Thanks to some brilliant death bowling from Mohit Sharma and Sandeep Sharma. ",Kings XI Punjab won by 7 runs,T20,Mumbai Indians vs Kings XI Punjab,5
"So Pune have made things a little more interesting as the race for the playoffs heats up. They are still in a pretty strong position, but don't have a 'Q' next to them in the table yet. 168 was a decent score on this pitch, but it was a total where the chasing team was never really out of the chase. The partnership which Manoj Tiwary and Ben Stokes had got going through the middle had in fact given Pune the upper hand. But Stokes's dismissal off a full toss turned the game around. Dhoni uncharacteristically faltered in game awareness and got run out, and the momentum of those couple of quick wickets enabled Delhi to turn things around and finish strongly.",Delhi Daredevils won by 7 runs,T20,Delhi Daredevils won by 7 runs,5
